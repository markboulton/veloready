## Technical Details

### Cache Key Format Change

**Before:**
```
{userId}:{date}:{version}:{sport}:{data-status}
Example: abc123:2025-10-15:coach-v4-sport:cycling:full
```

**After:**
```
{userId}:{date}:{version}:{data-status}
Example: abc123:2025-10-15:coach-v5-cycling:full
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Existing caches from `coach-v4-sport` will expire naturally
- ‚úÖ New requests use simpler cache key
- ‚úÖ No sport-specific cache pollution

### Request Payload Change

**Before:**
```json
{
  "recovery": 70,
  "sleepDelta": 0.5,
  "hrvDelta": 0.03,
  "rhrDelta": -0.01,
  "tsb": 4,
  "tssLow": 60,
  "tssHigh": 90,
  "plan": "Tempo",
  "primarySport": "cycling"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "recovery": 70,
  "sleepDelta": 0.5,
  "hrvDelta": 0.03,
  "rhrDelta": -0.01,
  "tsb": 4,
  "tssLow": 60,
  "tssHigh": 90,
  "plan": "Tempo"
}
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler request structure
- ‚úÖ Backend ignores unknown fields (forwards compatible)
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes for existing clients

---

## Rationale

**Product Focus:**
- VeloReady is built for cyclists
- Cycling-specific integrations (Strava, Intervals.icu, Wahoo)
- Cycling-specific metrics (FTP, TSS, power zones)
- Cycling-specific coaching language

**Simplicity:**
- One clear target audience
- One AI persona to refine and improve
- Simpler onboarding flow (6 steps vs 7)
- Less code to maintain

**User Experience:**
- No confusion about app purpose
- Immediate clarity on value proposition
- All features optimized for cycling
- Consistent coaching voice

---

## What Remains

**Sport Preferences Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ `SportPreferences` model still exists in codebase
- ‚úÖ Always defaults to `cycling` with rank 1
- ‚úÖ Can be used for future multi-sport expansion if needed
- ‚úÖ Syncs via iCloud

**Why keep it?**
- Minimal code
- No user-facing complexity
- Future-proofs architecture
- Clean default behavior
