## ‚è≥ Manual Steps Needed (You Do These)

### Step 1: Add Custom Domain in Netlify (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://app.netlify.com/projects/veloready
   ```

2. **Click "Domain settings"**

3. **Click "Add custom domain"**

4. **Enter:** `veloready.app`

5. **Click "Verify"** and **"Add domain"**

6. Netlify will show you DNS records to configure

### Step 2: Configure DNS (10 minutes)

**Where is veloready.app registered?**

You need to add these DNS records at your domain registrar:

**Option A: If Using Netlify DNS (Recommended):**
```
1. Click "Set up Netlify DNS" in domain settings
2. Update nameservers at your registrar to Netlify's nameservers
3. Wait 24-48 hours for propagation
```

**Option B: If Using External DNS (e.g., Cloudflare):**
```
Type    Name    Value                           TTL
A       @       75.2.60.5 (Netlify's IP)       Auto
CNAME   www     veloready.netlify.app          Auto
```

**To get Netlify's exact IP:**
1. In Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Domain Settings ‚Üí veloready.app
2. Look for "Netlify DNS records" or "External DNS"
3. Copy the IP address shown

### Step 3: Enable HTTPS (Automatic)

Once DNS is configured:
1. Netlify will automatically provision SSL certificate
2. Takes 1-2 hours after DNS propagates
3. HTTPS will be enabled automatically

### Step 4: Test Universal Links (After DNS)

```bash
# Test that the file is accessible
curl https://veloready.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association

# Should return JSON with your Team ID
```

## üîß Current Configuration

### netlify.toml (Deployed)
```toml
[build]
  command = "echo 'No build needed for static OAuth callbacks'"
  publish = "public"

# Redirect legacy domain
[[redirects]]
  from = "https://rideready.icu/*"
  to = "https://veloready.app/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

# Serve apple-app-site-association
[[redirects]]
  from = "/.well-known/apple-app-site-association"
  to = "/apple-app-site-association.json"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

### apple-app-site-association.json (Deployed)
```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "C79WM3NZ27.com.veloready.app",
        "paths": [
          "/auth/strava/callback",
          "/auth/intervals/callback",
          "/oauth/*",
          "/activities/*",
          "/trends/*"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "webcredentials": {
    "apps": [
      "C79WM3NZ27.com.veloready.app"
    ]
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Now (Netlify URL):
```bash
# Test apple-app-site-association is live
curl https://veloready.netlify.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association

# Should return JSON (not 404)
```

### Test After DNS (Custom Domain):
```bash
# Test custom domain works
curl https://veloready.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association

# Test redirects work
curl -I https://rideready.icu
# Should show 301 redirect to veloready.app
```

## üéØ Where We Are

### What Works Right Now:
- ‚úÖ https://veloready.netlify.app (live!)
- ‚úÖ https://veloready.netlify.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
- ‚úÖ GitHub repo live with all code
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployments on push

### What Needs Configuration:

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (5 minutes):
1. **Test current deployment:**
   ```bash
   open https://veloready.netlify.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
   ```
   Should see JSON with your Team ID!

### Short Term (15 minutes):
1. **Add custom domain in Netlify:**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/veloready
   - Domain settings ‚Üí Add custom domain ‚Üí veloready.app

2. **Configure DNS:**
   - At your domain registrar (where you bought veloready.app)
   - Add A record pointing to Netlify's IP
   - Or use Netlify DNS (easier)

### After DNS Propagates (24-48 hours):
1. **Test custom domain:**
   ```bash
   curl https://veloready.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
   ```

2. **Test on iPhone:**
   - Send email with: https://veloready.app/auth/strava/callback?code=test
   - Tap link ‚Üí Should open VeloReady app!

## üí° Pro Tips

### Automatic Deployments:
Every time you push to GitHub, Netlify will automatically:
- Pull the latest code
- Deploy to production
- Update the live site

To deploy manually:
```bash
cd /Users/markboulton/Dev/VeloReady
git push origin main
# Netlify deploys automatically!
```

### Update apple-app-site-association:
```bash
# Edit the file
nano public/apple-app-site-association.json

# Commit and push
git add public/apple-app-site-association.json
git commit -m "Update Universal Links configuration"
git push origin main

# Netlify deploys automatically in ~30 seconds
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Domain already in use" in Netlify:
- The domain might be registered to another Netlify site
- Check if rideready.icu is using it
- You may need to remove it from the old site first

### DNS not propagating:
- Wait 24-48 hours
- Check with: `dig veloready.app`
- Use: https://dnschecker.org to check globally

### apple-app-site-association returns 404:
- Check file exists in `public/` directory
- Check netlify.toml redirects are correct
- Redeploy if needed: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=public`
