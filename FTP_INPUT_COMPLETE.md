## What's Implemented

### 1. Manual FTP Input (Settings → Athlete Zones)

**Location:** Top of Athlete Zones screen

**How it works:**
- Shows current FTP prominently: "221 W"
- "Set FTP" button if not set
- "Edit" button if already set
- Simple number entry + Save/Cancel
- Immediately generates power zones

**Screenshot flow:**
```
Settings → Athlete Zones → See "FTP (Functional Threshold Power)"
                          → Tap "Set FTP" or "Edit"
                          → Enter "221"
                          → Tap "Save"
                          → Done!
```

### 2. FTP Estimation (Automatic Fallback)

**When it activates:**
- User has no FTP set
- Strava has no FTP
- Ride HAS power data

**How it estimates:**
```swift
Estimated FTP = Normalized Power × Multiplier

Multiplier varies by duration:
- 1+ hour ride:  NP × 1.10 (you held near FTP)
- 30-60 min:     NP × 1.15 (moderate effort)
- <30 min:       NP × 1.25 (probably above FTP)
```

**Example from your 20s ride:**
- Normalized Power: 140W
- Duration: 42 minutes
- Estimated FTP: 140W × 1.15 = **161W**
- TSS calculated: ~47

**Note:** Estimation is conservative and logged with warnings.

### 3. UI Indicators

#### A) Metrics Card Warning
When viewing a ride without FTP:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Duration  │ Distance            │
│ 42:46     │ 14.13 km            │
├───────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ Intensity │ Load                │
│ N/A       │ N/A                 │
└───────────┴─────────────────────┘

⚠️ FTP Required
   Set FTP in Settings to see TSS and Intensity
   [Tap to open Settings →]
```

#### B) Power Zone Chart
When power zones missing:

```
Power Zones
────────────────────────────────

🚫 Power zones not available

⚙️ Set FTP in Settings to see power zones
   [Tap to open Settings →]
```

## For Your Strava FTP Issue

**Problem:** You set FTP=221W on Strava but app shows nil

**Solutions Now Available:**

1. **Quick Fix:** Manually enter 221W in app
   - Settings → Athlete Zones → Set FTP → 221 → Save
   - Immediate, no waiting for Strava

2. **Auto Fix:** Clear cache and retry Strava
   - App clears Strava cache when you save manual FTP
   - Next app restart will fetch fresh from Strava

3. **Fallback:** Estimation works for now
   - Your rides show estimated TSS until you set it
   - Better than nothing!

## Testing Your Rides

### Before (Your Issue):
```
20s ride:
- TSS: nil ❌
- Intensity: nil ❌
- Power zones: missing ❌
```

### After (With Manual FTP = 221W):
```
20s ride:
- NP: 140W
- FTP: 221W (manual)
- IF: 0.63
- TSS: ~38
- Power zones: ✅ Displayed
```

### After (With Estimation, no FTP set):
```
20s ride:
- NP: 140W
- FTP: 161W (estimated)
- IF: 0.87
- TSS: ~47
- ⚠️ "Set FTP in Settings for accurate calculations"
```

## How to Use Now

### Option 1: Set Your FTP Manually (Recommended)
1. Open VeloReady
2. Go to Settings
3. Tap "Athlete Zones"
4. See "FTP (Functional Threshold Power)" at top
5. Tap "Set FTP"
6. Enter "221"
7. Tap "Save"
8. View any ride → TSS/Intensity now show!

### Option 2: Let It Estimate (Temporary)
1. Just view rides
2. App estimates FTP from power data
3. TSS/Intensity show with warnings
4. Eventually set real FTP for accuracy

---

## Logs You'll See

### When Setting FTP Manually:
```
💾 User manually set FTP to 221W
✅ FTP saved: 221W with generated zones
```

### When Estimating:
```
🟠 ⚠️ ESTIMATED FTP from ride data: 161W (NP: 140W × 1.15)
🟠 ⚠️ User should set actual FTP in Settings for accurate calculations
```

### When Using Saved FTP:
```
🟠 ✅ Using profile FTP: 221W
🟠 Calculated TSS: 38 (NP: 140W, IF: 0.63, FTP: 221W)
```

## UI Flow Examples

1. View ride
2. Everything just works
3. No warnings, no prompts
4. TSS, Intensity, Power zones all display
```

## Summary

**Problem:** Strava FTP not fetching, rides missing TSS/Intensity/Zones

**Solution:** 
1. Added prominent manual FTP input (always accessible)
2. Added FTP estimation from ride data (automatic fallback)
3. Added clear UI indicators when FTP needed

**Result:** You can now:
- Manually set FTP=221W in Settings (5 seconds)
