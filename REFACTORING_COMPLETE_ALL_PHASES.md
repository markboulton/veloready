## 💰 Value Delivered

### For Current Development
1. **Faster Feature Development**
   - Smaller files = easier to navigate
   - Clear structure = less confusion
   - Reusable components = less duplication

2. **Better Testing**
   - Can test sections in isolation
   - Can mock services easily
   - Faster test execution

3. **Easier Debugging**
   - Smaller files = easier to find bugs
   - Clear dependencies = easier to trace issues
   - Better separation = easier to isolate problems

### For Multi-App Strategy
1. **Portable Components**
   - Sections work in any app
   - Just pass different data
   - No VeloReady-specific code

2. **Configurable Architecture**
   - Can inject different services per app
   - Can customize behavior per app
   - Can brand per app

3. **Reduced Duplication**
   - Share code between apps
   - Maintain once, use everywhere
   - Consistent UX across apps

## 📝 Commits

### Commit 1: Phase 1 - Extract Sections
```
19ff33d refactor: Extract TodayView sections (Phase 1 complete)

- Extract RecoveryMetricsSection (270 lines)
- Extract HealthKitEnablementSection (80 lines)
- Extract RecentActivitiesSection (65 lines)
- Reduce TodayView from 1,056 → 719 lines (32% reduction)

## 🚀 What's Next (Optional)

### Phase 3: Configuration System (Future)
If you want to go further for multi-app:

```swift
struct TodayConfiguration {
    let showRecoveryMetrics: Bool
    let showAIBrief: Bool
    let showLatestRide: Bool
    let brandColors: BrandColors
    let featureFlags: FeatureFlags
}

// VeloReady
TodayView(config: .veloReady)

// RunReady (future)
TodayView(config: .runReady)
```

**Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Value**: True multi-app portability
