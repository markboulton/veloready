## 🔧 What You Need To Do in Xcode

### Step 1: Configure Signing (2 minutes)

**In Xcode (should be open now):**

1. **Select the project** (VeloReady at the top of the navigator)

2. **Select VeloReady target** (under TARGETS)

3. **Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab**

4. **Configure signing:**
   ```
   Team: (select your team - should show "Mark Boulton" or your name)
   
   ✓ Automatically manage signing
   
   Bundle Identifier: com.veloready.app (should already be set)
   ```

5. **Verify Capabilities are present:**
   - ✓ HealthKit
   - ✓ Associated Domains (veloready.app, rideready.icu)
   
   **If missing, add them:**
   - Click "+ Capability"
   - Add HealthKit
   - Add Associated Domains
     - applinks:veloready.app
     - applinks:rideready.icu

### Step 2: Update Entitlements Path (1 minute)

**Still in Signing & Capabilities:**

1. Look for "Code Signing Entitlements"
2. Should show: `VeloReady/VeloReady.entitlements`
3. If it shows `VeloReady/Rideready.entitlements`, update it to `VeloReady/VeloReady.entitlements`

### Step 3: Update Info.plist Path (1 minute)

1. **Select VeloReady target**
2. **Go to "Build Settings" tab**
3. **Search for "Info.plist"**
4. **Verify "Info.plist File" is set to:** `VeloReady/Info.plist`

### Step 4: Build! (1 minute)

1. **Select a simulator or your iPhone**
   - At the top: VeloReady > iPhone 15 Pro (or your device)

2. **Build the project**
   - Press ⌘ + B

3. **Fix any errors** (there shouldn't be any!)

4. **Run the app**
   - Press ⌘ + R

## 🐛 Potential Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Code signing error"
**Fix:**
- Signing & Capabilities → Team → Select your team
- Make sure "Automatically manage signing" is checked

### Issue 2: "Cannot find VeloReady.entitlements"
**Fix:**
- Build Settings → Code Signing Entitlements
- Change to: `VeloReady/VeloReady.entitlements`

### Issue 3: "Missing Info.plist"

### Issue 4: Widget target errors
**Fix:**

- Or ignore it for now

### Issue 5: "Module 'HealthKit' not found"
**Fix:**
- Signing & Capabilities → + Capability → HealthKit

## 🚀 Next Steps After Xcode Works

### 1. Configure OAuth Services (20 minutes)

**Strava:**
- https://www.strava.com/settings/api
- Add 4 callback URLs (see SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Intervals.icu:**
- https://intervals.icu/settings/api
- Add 4 redirect URIs (see SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### 2. Deploy to Netlify (30 minutes)

Want me to help with this? I can:
- Create GitHub repository (markboulton/veloready)
- Push code to GitHub
- Set up Netlify deployment
- Configure veloready.app domain

Just say: "Deploy to Netlify and GitHub"

### 3. Test OAuth on Physical Device

Once OAuth is configured:
- Build to your iPhone
- Test Strava OAuth flow
- Test Intervals.icu OAuth flow
- Verify Universal Links work

Be patient on the first build! (~2-3 minutes)
