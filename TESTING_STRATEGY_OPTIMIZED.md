# VeloReady Testing Strategy - Optimized for Rapid Development

## Overview

This document outlines our optimized testing strategy based on the tiered approach discussed with Gemini, designed to balance rapid development with high-quality releases.

## Core Philosophy

**"Test the right things at the right time"** - We don't run all tests all the time. We run the right tests at the right moment to give developers the fastest possible feedback while maintaining quality.

## Tiered Testing Strategy

### Tier 1: Fast Feedback (Every Push) - 5-10 minutes
**Goal**: Immediate feedback on code quality and basic functionality

**Triggers**: 
- Every push to feature branches
- Every push to main

**Tests**:
- SwiftLint (static analysis)
- Unit tests only
- Critical integration tests (subset)

**Why**: Catches basic errors immediately without blocking development flow

### Tier 2: Pre-Merge Confidence (PR Ready) - 15-30 minutes
**Goal**: Full confidence before merging to main

**Triggers**:
- PR marked as "Ready for Review"
- PR opened (if not draft)

**Tests**:
- All unit tests
- Full integration test suite
- E2E smoke tests (critical user journeys only)
- Backend API tests

**Why**: Prevents broken code from reaching main branch

### Tier 3: Post-Merge Verification (Main Branch) - 30-60 minutes
**Goal**: Verify main branch stability and create release artifacts

**Triggers**:
- Push to main branch
- Nightly scheduled runs

**Tests**:
- Full E2E test suite (all scenarios)
- Multi-device testing (iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone SE)
- Multi-iOS version testing (iOS 17, iOS 18)
- Performance tests

**Why**: Ensures main branch is always stable and ready for release

## Branching Strategy

### Simple 3-Branch Model

1. **`main`**: Always stable, tested, ready for release
2. **`feature/*`**: All new development work
3. **`release/*`**: Preparation for App Store submission

### Development Workflow

#### Rapid Development Loop
```bash
# 1. Start new work
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# 2. Code & test locally (fast feedback)
./scripts/local-test.sh  # Runs Tier 1 tests

# 3. Push for CI feedback
git push -u origin feature/my-new-feature
# Triggers Tier 1 tests automatically
```

#### Review & Merge Loop
```bash
# 4. Open PR when ready
# Triggers Tier 2 tests (Integration + E2E Smoke)

# 5. Address feedback, push changes
git push  # Re-runs Tier 2 tests

# 6. Merge when all checks pass
# Triggers Tier 3 tests (Full E2E)
```

#### Release Loop
```bash
# 7. Create release branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# 8. Final testing & bug fixes
# Run full test suite, submit to TestFlight

# 9. Deploy to App Store
# Tag release: git tag v1.2.0
```

## Local Development Tools

### Quick Test Script
```bash
./scripts/local-test.sh
```
- Runs Tier 1 tests locally
- Provides immediate feedback
- Shows next steps for CI

### Individual Test Commands
```bash
# Unit tests only
xcodebuild test -workspace VeloReady.xcworkspace -scheme VeloReady -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' -only-testing:VeloReadyTests/Unit

# Integration tests only
xcodebuild test -workspace VeloReady.xcworkspace -scheme VeloReady -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' -only-testing:VeloReadyTests/Integration

# Backend tests
cd ../veloready-website && npm test
```

## CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

### Parallel Execution
All test tiers run in parallel where possible:
- Lint, Unit Tests, Integration Tests run simultaneously
- E2E tests run in parallel across different devices/OS versions

### Caching Strategy
- CocoaPods dependencies
- Swift Package Manager packages
- DerivedData (build artifacts)
- Node.js dependencies

### Conditional Execution
- Draft PRs only run Tier 1 tests
- Ready PRs run Tier 2 tests
- Main branch runs Tier 3 tests

## E2E Test Organization

### Smoke Tests (Tier 2)
Critical user journeys only:
- `training-load.yaml` - Core functionality
- `onboarding.yaml` - User onboarding

### Full Suite (Tier 3)
All user scenarios:
- `activity-sync.yaml` - Data synchronization
- `ai-brief.yaml` - AI features
- `recovery-score.yaml` - Recovery metrics

## Performance Considerations

### Build Optimization
- Use simulators for PR tests (faster than real devices)
- Cache build artifacts between runs
- Parallel job execution
- Conditional test execution based on changed files

### Test Optimization
- Eliminate flaky tests
- Use realistic but minimal test data
- Mock external services appropriately
- Focus on critical paths first

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Success Metrics
- PR merge time (target: <30 minutes for Tier 2)
- Build success rate (target: >95%)
- Test flakiness rate (target: <2%)

### Failure Handling
- Immediate notification on Tier 1 failures
- Detailed reports on Tier 2/3 failures
- Automatic retry for flaky tests (max 2 retries)

## Benefits of This Strategy

### For Developers
- **Fast feedback**: Tier 1 tests run in 5-10 minutes
- **Clear workflow**: Know exactly what to run when
- **Reduced context switching**: Tests run automatically
- **Confidence**: Know when code is ready to merge

### For Quality
- **Prevents regressions**: Full test suite before merge
- **Catches edge cases**: Multi-device/OS testing
- **Maintains stability**: Main branch always deployable
- **Reduces bugs**: Comprehensive testing coverage

### For Velocity
- **No blocking**: Fast tests don't slow development
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple tests run simultaneously
- **Smart triggers**: Right tests at the right time
- **Local testing**: Catch issues before pushing

## Implementation Status
