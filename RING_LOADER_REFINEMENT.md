# Ring Loader Refinement - Complete ✅

## 🎯 Final Implementation

Clean, minimal loading state for recovery metric rings using only the branded `PulseScaleLoader` - no text, no clutter.

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### User Feedback:
> "no, revert that last change, it looks terrible. Also, remove the text label of 'loading' which appears in the compact rings. The spinner is enough. That must be centered in the ring."

### Actions Taken:

#### 1. **Reverted LoadingSpinner & LoadingStateView** ✅
- Kept these components using generic `ProgressView()`
- The branded loader doesn't work well in all contexts
- Only use branded loader in specific places (rings, full-screen)

#### 2. **Removed "?" from CompactRingView** ✅
- When `score` is nil, no "?" is shown
- The `PulseScaleLoader` is overlaid externally in the parent view
- Clean, centered spinner without any text

#### 3. **Kept PulseScaleLoader in Rings** ✅
- Recovery, Sleep, and Strain rings use 40pt branded loader
- Centered perfectly in the ring
- No text, no "?", just the elegant pulse animation

## 📝 Final State

### What Uses Branded PulseScaleLoader:
- ✅ **Recovery/Sleep/Strain rings** (40pt, centered)
- ✅ **Full-screen loading overlay** (80pt) - already used

### What Uses Generic ProgressView:
- ✅ **LoadingSpinner** - Generic spinner for various contexts
- ✅ **LoadingStateView** - Generic loading states
- ✅ **Settings views** - Contextual loading indicators
- ✅ **Detail views** - Inline loading states
- ✅ **Buttons** - Inline button loading

## 🎨 Visual Result

### Recovery/Sleep/Strain Rings During Loading:

**Before (cluttered):**
```
[Ring with background]
   "?" (question mark)
   ProgressView (generic spinner)
   "Updating..." (text)
```
= **Too much!**

**After (clean):**
```
[Ring with background]
   PulseScaleLoader (40pt, centered)
```
= **Perfect!** Just the branded animation, nothing else
