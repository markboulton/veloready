# Today's Fixes Summary - Oct 16, 2025

## ✅ **2 Critical Issues FIXED**

---

## 1. 🚨 Threading Violations (CRITICAL) - FIXED ✅

### Problem
- **32 instances** of `Publishing changes from background threads is not allowed`
- Could cause **random app crashes**
- Happened during adaptive FTP/HR zone calculations

### Fix
- Wrapped ALL `@Published profile` updates in `await MainActor.run { }`
- Made helper functions async
- Updated 5 locations in `AthleteProfile.swift`

### Verification
✅ **Your logs show ZERO threading warnings!**

```
# Before: 32 violations
# After:  0 violations ✅
```

**Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING**

---

## 2. ⚡ Excessive Disk Writes (PERFORMANCE) - FIXED ✅

### Problem  
- **26 disk writes** during app startup
- Every `@Published` property triggered save
- Unnecessary battery drain & slower startup

### Fix
- Added `isLoading` flag to `UserSettings`
- Prevents saves during initialization
- Only saves on actual user changes

### Code Changes
```swift
// UserSettings.swift
private var isLoading = false

private func saveSettings() {
    guard !isLoading else { return }  // Skip during init
    // ... save logic
}

private func loadSettings() {
    isLoading = true
    defer { isLoading = false }
    // ... load properties (no saves triggered!)
}
```

### Expected Result
- **Before:** 26 saves during startup
- **After:** 0-1 saves (only on actual changes)
- **Improvement:** ~96% reduction

**Status:** ⏳ **FIXED, NEEDS QUICK RETEST**

## 📊 Performance Improvements

| Issue | Before | After | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Threading violations | 32 | 0 | ✅ Verified |
| Startup disk writes | 26 | ~1 | ⏳ Needs test |
| Build status | ✅ | ✅ | - |

---

## 🔬 Quick Retest (2 min)

### To verify UserDefaults fix:

1. **Clean build:** `Cmd+Shift+K`, then `Cmd+B`
2. **Launch app**
3. **Check Console:** Filter for `User settings`
4. **Count saves:** Should see **0-1** instead of 26

Expected log:
```
📱 User settings loaded
# Should NOT see 26x "💾 User settings saved"
```

## 🔧 Other Items Identified

### Dashboard Consolidation
- **Action:** Consolidate to https://veloready.app/ops/
- **Status:** To do

### Training Load Cache
- **Issue:** Re-fetching after force quit
- **Status:** Needs investigation

## 📝 Files Modified

1. `/VeloReady/Core/Models/AthleteProfile.swift`
   - Made 3 functions async
   - Added 5 `await MainActor.run { }` blocks
   
2. `/VeloReady/Core/Models/UserSettings.swift`
   - Added `isLoading` flag
   - Updated `saveSettings()`, `loadSettings()`, `resetToDefaults()`

---

## ✅ Summary

**Both critical bugs are FIXED:**

1. ✅ **Threading:** Verified working (0 warnings in your logs)
2. ⚡ **Performance:** Fixed (just needs quick rebuild to verify)

**Total time:** ~30 minutes  
**Build status:** ✅ Success  
**App stability:** Much improved

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Rebuild** and verify only 1 save during startup
2. (Optional) Investigate Training Load cache behavior
3. (Optional) Consolidate dashboard URLs
