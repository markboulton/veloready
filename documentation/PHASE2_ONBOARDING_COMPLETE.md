## Design Decisions

### Why This Flow?

**Screen Order Rationale:**
1. **Welcome** - Set expectations
2. **What We Do** - Build understanding
3. **Sport Ranking** - **Critical data capture for AI**
4. **Apple Health** - Essential permissions
5. **Platform Integration** - Optional, sport-aware
6. **Profile** - Personalization
7. **Pro Features** - Monetization

**Sport Ranking First:**
- Must know sport preference before showing integrations
- Early capture ensures AI has data from day one
- Users understand app adapts to their needs

**Conditional Data Sources:**
- Reduces cognitive load for non-cyclists
- Shows only relevant integrations
- Improves completion rate

### Design Patterns Used:
- Card-based layouts for scanability
- Color-coded categories for distinction
- Visual feedback (badges, highlights)
- Progressive disclosure
- Optional steps clearly marked

## API Ready for Phase 3

The onboarding now captures and saves:
```swift
// Access from anywhere in app
let primarySport = UserSettings.shared.primarySport
// .cycling, .strength, or .general

// Full rankings
let rankings = UserSettings.shared.sportPreferences.rankings
// [.cycling: 1, .strength: 2, .general: 3]
```

This data will be sent to backend AI functions in Phase 3.

## Status: READY FOR PHASE 3 ‚úÖ

All Phase 2 objectives completed. New onboarding flow is live and capturing sport preferences. Ready to implement AI personalization.
