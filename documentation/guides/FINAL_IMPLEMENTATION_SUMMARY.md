## ✅ Testing & Validation

### **Your Action Items**

#### **1. Verify Cache is Working** (5 minutes) ✅

Run the app and check Xcode console for these logs:

**First launch (Cache MISS expected):**
```
[Cache MISS] healthkit:hrv:1729328400.0
[Cache STORE] healthkit:hrv:1729328400.0 (cost: 1KB)
```

**Second recovery calc (within 5 min):**
```
⚡ [Cache HIT] healthkit:hrv:1729328400.0 (age: 45s)  ← INSTANT!
```

**Open same activity twice:**
```
⚡ Stream cache HIT: strava_16156463870 (3199 samples, age: 5m)  ← INSTANT!
```

#### **2. View Cache Statistics** (2 minutes) ✅

1. Open app → Settings → Debug → Monitoring → **Cache Statistics**
2. Check hit rate (should be >85% after warm-up)
3. View performance metrics
4. Check memory usage

#### **3. Test Performance** (10 minutes) ⏳ **Optional**

1. Open app cold (first time)
2. Navigate through all screens
3. Close app completely
4. Open app again (should be much faster)
5. Check console for cache hits
6. View cache statistics dashboard

## 🎓 How To Use New Features

### **Cache Statistics Dashboard**

**Location:** Settings → Debug → Monitoring → **Cache Statistics**

**What You'll See:**
- **Unified Cache:** Hit rate, hits, misses, deduplicated requests
- **Stream Cache:** Activity count, samples, hit rate  
- **Performance Metrics:** Operation timings (avg, P95, max)
- **Memory:** Current app memory usage
- **Actions:** Print stats, reset, clear all caches

**How To Interpret:**
- **Hit Rate >85%** 🟢 Excellent - cache working perfectly
- **Hit Rate 70-85%** 🟠 Good - normal during warm-up
- **Hit Rate <70%** 🔴 Issue - cache may need adjustment

### **Performance Logging**

Automatically logs operation durations to console:

```
⚡ [Fetch Activities] 45ms  ← Fast operation
🐌 SLOW: [Heavy Calculation] 1200ms  ← Slow operation warning
```

View all statistics in Cache Statistics dashboard or console.

**View Dashboards:**
- Settings → Debug → Monitoring → Cache Statistics
- Settings → Debug → Monitoring → Service Health
- Settings → Debug → Monitoring → Component Telemetry

**Cache Statistics:**
```swift
// In code or console
let stats = UnifiedCacheManager.shared.getStatistics()
print(stats.description)

// Print all performance stats
await PerformanceMonitor.shared.printAllStatistics()
```

**Memory Profiling:**
- Use Xcode Instruments → Allocations
- Check app memory in Cache Statistics dashboard
- Should stay under 100MB total
