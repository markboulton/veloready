# VeloReady ML: Clear Next Steps

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Current Status:** 21 days collected, 9 days to go  
**Next Milestone:** November 8, 2025 (30 days)

---

## TL;DR

**What you asked:** "What is the plan for ML? Debug shows no model is being used."

**Answer:** 
- You have 21/30 days of data collected ‚úÖ
- Training infrastructure is built and ready ‚úÖ
- No model trained yet because you need 30 days minimum ‚è≥
- Debug correctly shows "None" - this is expected ‚úÖ

**What to do next:** Wait 9 days, then train model on Mac (1-2 hours)

---

## Today: Understanding (‚úÖ YOU ARE HERE)

### What You Have
‚úÖ **Data Collection:** 21 days automatically collected  
‚úÖ **Infrastructure:** Complete ML pipeline built  
‚úÖ **Features:** 38 features captured daily  
‚úÖ **Training Code:** Ready to execute when you have 30 days

### What You Don't Have
‚ùå **Trained Model:** None (need 30 days minimum)  
‚ùå **Predictions:** Can't predict without model  
‚ùå **UI Updates:** Prediction service not implemented yet

### Why Debug Shows "No Model"
This is **correct and expected**. The app is:
- Collecting data daily ‚úÖ
- Storing to Core Data ‚úÖ
- Waiting for 30 days threshold ‚è≥
- Ready to train when you hit 30 days ‚úÖ

**Status:** Everything is working as designed.

## Next 9 Days: Passive Data Collection (Oct 31 - Nov 7)

### Your Action Items
- [ ] Continue using app normally
- [ ] Wear Apple Watch overnight (for HRV/RHR)
- [ ] Sync Intervals.icu daily (for TSS)
- [ ] No code changes needed

### What's Happening Automatically
The app collects data every day:
```
Daily App Launch:
1. Check: Is it a new day? ‚úì
2. Aggregate last 90 days from HealthKit/Strava/Intervals
3. Engineer 38 features per day
4. Store to Core Data
5. Update count: 22, 23, 24... ‚Üí 30 days
```

### Optional: Monitor Progress
```
Settings ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí ML Infrastructure
Check: "Training Data: XX days"
```

**Expected:** Count increases by 1 each day

---

## November 8, 2025: Train First Model (1-2 hours)

### Prerequisites
- [x] 30+ days of data (will have by Nov 8)
- [ ] Mac with Xcode installed
- [ ] 1-2 hours of time

### Option 1: Train via Debug UI (Easiest)

**Step-by-step:**
1. Open VeloReady app on **macOS**
2. Navigate to: `Settings ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí ML Infrastructure`
3. Verify: "Training Data: 30+ days"
4. Tap button: **"Test Training Pipeline"**
5. Wait ~60 seconds (watch logs)
6. Success message: "‚úÖ Pipeline test PASSED"
7. Verify: "Current Model: 1.0" (should appear)

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Pipeline test PASSED
   Samples: 24 train, 6 test
   MAE: 8.2
   Training time: 45.3s
   Exported to: TestModel.mlmodel
```

**Success Criteria:**
- MAE < 10 (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE < 12 (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R¬≤ > 0.6 (explains 60%+ of variance)
- File size < 1MB

### Option 2: Train via Code

Create a debug button or script:

```swift
// In MLDebugView or separate script
Task {
    let trainer = MLModelTrainer()
    
    // Train model
    let result = try await trainer.trainModel()
    
    // Export model
    let modelURL = try trainer.exportModel(result.model)
    
    // Register in registry
    let metadata = MLModelMetadata(
        version: "1.0",
        phase: .baseline,
        createdAt: Date(),
        trainingSampleCount: result.trainingSamples,
        validationAccuracy: result.metrics.rSquared,
        modelType: .tabularRegressor,
        isValid: result.metrics.isGoodQuality
    )
    
    MLModelRegistry.shared.registerModel(metadata: metadata)
    try MLModelRegistry.shared.deployModel(version: "1.0")
    
    print("Model trained and deployed!")
    print("MAE: \(result.metrics.mae)")
    print("Model at: \(modelURL.path)")
}
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "Insufficient training data"  
**Solution:** Wait for 30 days, currently at 21

**Problem:** "Create ML not available"  
**Solution:** Must run on macOS (not iOS)

**Problem:** "MAE > 10 (poor accuracy)"  
**Solution:** Normal for first model, will improve with more data

**Problem:** "Training crashes"  
**Solution:** Check logs, may need to adjust training config

## Week of November 11: Implement Predictions (Week 3)

### Status
**Code to write:** ~2-3 days of work  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Priority:** High (to actually use the model)

### Tasks

#### Day 1-2: Prediction Service
1. Create `MLPredictionService.swift`

   - Predict with today's features
   - Return confidence score

2. Create `PersonalizedRecoveryCalculator.swift`
   - Wrapper around MLPredictionService
   - Feature vector preparation
   - Result interpretation

3. Update `RecoveryScoreService.swift`
   - Check: Model available?
   - If yes ‚Üí Use ML prediction

#### Day 3: UI Integration
1. Update `RecoveryScore` model
   ```swift
   struct RecoveryScore {
       let score: Int
       let isPersonalized: Bool  // NEW

       let method: PredictionMethod // NEW
   }
   ```

2. Update Today view
   - Show "‚ú® Personalized" badge when ML active
   - Add info button explaining personalization
   - Show confidence if available

#### Day 4: Settings
1. Add ML Personalization settings section

## Key Metrics to Track

### Data Quality
- **Days collected:** 21 ‚Üí 30 ‚Üí 40+
- **Valid days:** Should match total days
- **Completeness:** Target > 80%

### Model Performance
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Target < 8 points
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Target < 10 points
- **R¬≤ (Variance explained):** Target > 0.7

### User Impact
- **Prediction accuracy:** Better than rule-based
- **Inference time:** < 50ms
- **Battery impact:** < 5% daily
- **Adoption rate:** Target 60%+ keep enabled

---

## Questions?

### "Can I train with 21 days?"
**Yes, but not recommended.** Accuracy will be lower (MAE ~12-15 vs target 8-10). Wait for 30.

### "Why macOS only?"
Create ML framework is macOS-only. Alternatives: TensorFlow ‚Üí Core ML, but more complex.

### "Will it auto-retrain?"
Not yet. Week 4 adds weekly background retraining. Manual for now.

### "What if predictions are bad?"
Automatic fallback to rule-based. User can disable ML in Settings.

### "How do I know it's working?"
Debug view shows model version + predictions will say "Personalized" with ‚ú® indicator.
