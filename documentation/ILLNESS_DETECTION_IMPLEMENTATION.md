# Illness Detection Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive illness detection system for VeloReady that identifies potential body stress signals through multi-day physiological trend analysis. The system is positioned as a wellness awareness tool (not medical advice) and aligns with Apple Health guidelines and competitor approaches (Oura, Whoop, Garmin).

## Implementation Date
October 20, 2025

## Key Components

### 1. Data Models

#### `IllnessIndicator` (Core/Models/IllnessIndicator.swift)
- **Purpose**: Represents detected illness indicators with severity, confidence, and affected signals
- **Severity Levels**: Low, Moderate, High
- **Signal Types**:
  - HRV Drop (15% below baseline)
  - Elevated RHR (5% above baseline)
  - Respiratory Rate Change (10% deviation)
  - Sleep Disruption (20% drop in quality)
  - Activity Drop (30% below baseline)
  - Temperature Elevation (0.5°C above baseline)
- **Detection Algorithm**: Requires minimum 2 signals for detection
- **Confidence Calculation**: Based on signal count and deviation magnitude

### 2. Services

#### `IllnessDetectionService` (Core/Services/IllnessDetectionService.swift)
- **Architecture**: Singleton service with `@MainActor` isolation
- **Analysis Window**: 7 days of historical data
- **Minimum Data Points**: 3 days required for reliable detection
- **Analysis Interval**: Maximum once per hour (prevents redundant calculations)

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Caching Integration**: Uses `UnifiedCacheManager` for performance
  - Cache TTL: 10 minutes (wellness data)
  - Automatic request deduplication
  - Memory-efficient NSCache implementation
  
- ✅ **ML-Enhanced Pattern Recognition**:
  - Trend consistency analysis (increasing/decreasing patterns)
  - Multi-day sustained trend detection
  - Confidence boosting for consistent patterns
  - Worsening trend detection
  
- ✅ **Multi-Day Data Fetching**:
  - HRV (Heart Rate Variability)
  - RHR (Resting Heart Rate)
  - Sleep Score
  - Respiratory Rate
  - Activity Level (step count)

**Detection Thresholds** (Research-Based):
```swift
HRV Drop: -15%
RHR Elevation: +5%
Sleep Quality Drop: -20%
Respiratory Change: ±10%
Activity Drop: -30%
Temperature: +0.5°C
```

### 3. Content Architecture

#### `CommonContent` Enhancements
Added illness detection strings:
- `WellnessAlerts`: Body stress detected, unusual patterns, rest recommended
- `IllnessIndicators`: Severity levels, signal types, status messages

#### `WellnessContent` Enhancements
Added comprehensive illness detection content:
- `IllnessDetection.title`: "Body Stress Signals"
- `IllnessDetection.subtitle`: "Potential strain indicators"
- Detection messages and confidence levels
- Detailed signal descriptions
- Severity-specific recommendations

**Recommendations by Severity**:
- **Low**: Monitor, reduce intensity, prioritize sleep/hydration
- **Moderate**: Light activity or rest, focus on recovery
- **High**: Rest strongly recommended, consider healthcare provider

### 4. UI Components

#### `IllnessIndicatorCard` (Design/Components/IllnessIndicatorCard.swift)
- **Purpose**: Compact card showing illness indicator summary
- **Design Tokens**: Uses global `Spacing`, `Typography`, `ColorScale`
- **Features**:
  - Severity-based color coding (yellow/amber/red)
  - Confidence badge
  - Primary signal display
  - Recommendation preview
  - Tap to view details

#### `IllnessDetailSheet` (Design/Components/IllnessDetailSheet.swift)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive detail view for illness indicators
- **Presentation**: Half-sheet modal (.medium, .large detents)
- **Sections**:
  1. Header with severity and confidence
  2. Medical disclaimer
  3. What we detected
  4. All affected metrics (with detailed descriptions)
  5. Recommendations (severity-specific)
  6. When to seek medical advice

**Design System Compliance**:
- ✅ Uses global `Spacing` enum (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl)
- ✅ Uses global `Typography` (.body, .caption, .title3 with weights)
- ✅ Uses `ColorScale` for all colors (no hardcoded values)
- ✅ Consistent corner radius via `Spacing.cardCornerRadius`

### 5. Integration

#### Today View Integration
**File**: `Features/Today/Views/Dashboard/TodayView.swift`

**Changes**:
1. Added `@StateObject private var illnessService = IllnessDetectionService.shared`
2. Added `@State private var showingIllnessDetailSheet = false`
3. Display illness card when indicator is significant
4. Sheet presentation for detailed view
5. Automatic analysis triggers:
   - On view appear (after 5 second delay)
   - On app foreground
   - After wellness analysis completes

**Display Logic**:
```swift
if healthKitManager.isAuthorized,
   let indicator = illnessService.currentIndicator,
   indicator.isSignificant {
    IllnessIndicatorCard(indicator: indicator) {
        showingIllnessDetailSheet = true
    }
}
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Performance Optimization
1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - 10-minute TTL for wellness data
   - Request deduplication prevents redundant API calls
   - Memory-efficient NSCache with automatic eviction
   
2. **Analysis Throttling**:
   - Minimum 1-hour interval between analyses
   - Prevents excessive computation
   - Respects user's battery and device resources

3. **Async/Await**:
   - All network/HealthKit operations are async
   - Parallel data fetching for multiple metrics
   - Non-blocking UI updates

### ML Integration Strategy
The illness detection service uses ML-enhanced pattern recognition:

1. **Trend Consistency Analysis**:
   - Calculates how consistent a trend is in expected direction
   - Returns value 0.0 (no consistency) to 1.0 (perfect consistency)
   
2. **Confidence Adjustment**:
   - Sustained multi-day trends boost confidence by 10%
   - Multiple concurrent signals boost confidence by 5% per additional signal
   - Recent worsening trends detected and logged
   
3. **Future ML Enhancements**:
   - Could integrate with `MLPredictionService` for predictive illness detection
   - Could use `PersonalizedRecoveryCalculator` for user-specific thresholds
   - Could leverage `HistoricalDataAggregator` for baseline calculations

## Non-Medical Positioning

### Compliance with Apple Health Guidelines
✅ **Not a Medical Device**:
- Positioned as "Body Stress Signals" not "Illness Detection"
- Uses terms like "potential strain indicators"
- Clear disclaimers throughout UI
- Encourages consulting healthcare professionals

✅ **Educational/Informational**:
- Provides observations from data
- Explains what metrics mean
- Offers general wellness recommendations
- No diagnostic claims

### Competitor Alignment
**Similar to**:
- **Oura**: "Readiness Score" with illness detection
- **Whoop**: "Strain" and "Recovery" with anomaly detection
- **Garmin**: "Body Battery" with stress signals

**Differentiators**:
- More transparent about detection methodology
- Clearer non-medical positioning
- Integrated with existing recovery/wellness system

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Debug Mode**: Enable wellness warning in `ProFeatureConfig`
2. **Verify Display**: Check illness card appears in Today view
3. **Tap Interaction**: Verify detail sheet opens
4. **Content Accuracy**: Verify all strings use abstracted content
5. **Design Tokens**: Verify no hardcoded colors/spacing

### Unit Testing (Future)
```swift
// Test detection algorithm
func testIllnessDetection_withMultipleSignals_detectsModerate()
func testIllnessDetection_withInsufficientData_returnsNil()
func testMLConfidenceAdjustment_withSustainedTrend_boostsConfidence()

// Test caching
func testIllnessDetectionService_usesCachedResults()
func testIllnessDetectionService_respectsAnalysisInterval()
```

### Integration Testing
1. Verify HealthKit data fetching
2. Verify baseline calculations
3. Verify cache invalidation
4. Verify UI updates on detection
