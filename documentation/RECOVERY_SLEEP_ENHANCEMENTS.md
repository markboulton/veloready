## Research Foundation

All new metrics are based on peer-reviewed sports science research:

1. **Recovery Debt** - Halson & Jeukendrup (2004): Monitoring training in athletes
2. **Sleep Debt** - Van Dongen et al. (2003): The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness
3. **Readiness Score** - Saw et al. (2016): Monitoring the athlete training response
4. **Sleep Consistency** - Phillips et al. (2017): Irregular sleep patterns impair recovery
5. **Resilience Score** - Buchheit (2014): Monitoring training status with HR measures

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Core Models (Commit: 7fb44a7)

Created 5 new scoring models with research-backed algorithms:

#### 1. RecoveryDebt
- Tracks consecutive days of suboptimal recovery
- Bands: Fresh (0-2 days), Accumulating (3-4), Significant (5-6), Critical (7+)
- Prevents overtraining by early warning

#### 2. SleepDebt
- Tracks cumulative sleep deficit over 7 days
- Bands: Minimal (<2h), Moderate (2-4h), Significant (4-6h), Critical (6h+)
- Accounts for individual sleep need

#### 3. ReadinessScore
- Composite metric: Recovery (40%) + Sleep (35%) + Load (25%)
- Provides single actionable training recommendation
- Bands: Fully Ready, Ready, Compromised, Not Ready

#### 4. SleepConsistency
- Measures circadian rhythm health via schedule variability
- Standard deviation of bedtime/wake times
- Bands: Excellent (<30min), Good (30-60min), Fair (60-90min), Poor (>90min)

#### 5. ResilienceScore
- 30-day metric tracking recovery capacity vs training load
- Identifies if athlete handles load well or struggles
- Bands: High, Good, Moderate, Low

**Enhanced SleepScore:**
- Added sleep latency tracking (time to fall asleep)
- Updated HealthKitSleepData to capture firstSleepTime

### Phase 2: Service Integration (Commit: afed11d)

Integrated all new metrics into existing services:

**RecoveryScoreService:**
- Added @Published properties for RecoveryDebt, ReadinessScore, ResilienceScore
- calculateRecoveryDebt(): Fetches 14-day history from Core Data
- calculateReadinessScore(): Combines recovery, sleep, and strain
- calculateResilienceScore(): Analyzes 30-day recovery capacity

**SleepScoreService:**
- Added @Published properties for SleepDebt, SleepConsistency
- calculateSleepDebt(): Tracks 7-day cumulative deficit
- calculateSleepConsistency(): Measures circadian rhythm health

All metrics calculated automatically after main scores with async/await patterns.

---

### Phase 3: Content Architecture (Commit: 85caca6)

Enhanced content with actionable guidance:

**RecoveryContent:**
- Enhanced descriptions with training intensity guidance
- Added NewMetrics enum for new metrics labels

**SleepContent:**
- Enhanced descriptions with recovery context
- Added NewMetrics enum for new metrics labels

**New ReadinessContent:**
- Complete content structure for Readiness Score
- Training recommendations by readiness level
- Intensity guidance with specific workout types

---

### Phase 4: UI Components (Commit: 5bc99b9)

Created reusable SwiftUI components:

**ReadinessCardView:**
- Large featured card for Readiness Score
- Component breakdown (Recovery, Sleep, Load)
- Training recommendations

**DebtMetricCard:**
- Compact horizontal card for debt metrics
- Supports Recovery Debt and Sleep Debt
- Shows primary value with band indicator

**SimpleMetricCard:**
- Vertical card for consistency and resilience
- Shows score out of 100 with band
- Additional detail metrics

All components follow existing design patterns with ColorScale tokens.

## Key Features

### 1. Research-Backed Algorithms
Every metric is based on peer-reviewed sports science research with proper citations.

### 2. Actionable Insights
All metrics provide specific recommendations:
- Recovery Debt: When to schedule rest
- Sleep Debt: How much extra sleep needed
- Readiness: What intensity to train at
- Consistency: How to improve sleep schedule
- Resilience: Whether to increase/decrease load

### 3. Proactive Monitoring
- Recovery Debt warns before overtraining occurs
- Sleep Debt identifies cumulative fatigue
- Readiness prevents training when not ready

### 4. Individual Adaptation
- Sleep need personalized per user
- Resilience tracks individual capacity
- Readiness accounts for personal recovery patterns

### 5. Seamless Integration
- Uses existing Core Data infrastructure
- Leverages HealthKit data already fetched
- Maintains app performance
- Automatic calculation with main scores

---

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- HealthKit: Sleep stages, HRV, RHR, heart rate
- Core Data: Historical scores (DailyScores entity)
- User Settings: Sleep need, preferences

### Performance
- Async/await for non-blocking calculations
- Parallel metric calculation
- Cached results in services
- Efficient Core Data queries

### Architecture
- Models: Codable structs with static calculators
- Services: ObservableObject with @Published properties
- Content: Centralized strings for localization
- UI: Reusable SwiftUI components

## Usage Examples

### Accessing Metrics in Code

```swift
// Recovery metrics
let recoveryDebt = RecoveryScoreService.shared.currentRecoveryDebt
let readiness = RecoveryScoreService.shared.currentReadinessScore
let resilience = RecoveryScoreService.shared.currentResilienceScore

// Sleep metrics
let sleepDebt = SleepScoreService.shared.currentSleepDebt
let consistency = SleepScoreService.shared.currentSleepConsistency
```

### Using UI Components

```swift
// Readiness card
if let readiness = recoveryService.currentReadinessScore {
    ReadinessCardView(readinessScore: readiness) {
        // Navigate to detail view
    }
}

// Debt cards
if let recoveryDebt = recoveryService.currentRecoveryDebt {
    DebtMetricCard(debtType: .recovery(recoveryDebt)) {
        // Show detail
    }
}

if let sleepDebt = sleepService.currentSleepDebt {
    DebtMetricCard(debtType: .sleep(sleepDebt)) {
        // Show detail
    }
}
```

1. Parasympathetic Reactivation Index (HRV trajectory during sleep)
2. REM/Deep Sleep Ratio analysis
3. Temperature trend analysis for illness detection
