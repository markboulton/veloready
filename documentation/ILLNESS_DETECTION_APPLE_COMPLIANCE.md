## Date
October 20, 2025

## Executive Summary
‚úÖ **VeloReady's illness detection feature is COMPLIANT with Apple App Store guidelines** when positioned as "Body Stress Signals" rather than medical diagnosis.

## Apple App Store Requirements

### Section 1.4.1 - Medical Apps
> "Medical apps that could provide inaccurate data or information, or that could be used for diagnosing or treating patients may be reviewed with greater scrutiny."

**Our Compliance**:
- ‚úÖ We do NOT claim to diagnose disease
- ‚úÖ We do NOT claim to treat or cure conditions
- ‚úÖ We position as wellness/fitness monitoring
- ‚úÖ We are NOT a medical device

### Section 5.1.3 - Health Data Usage
> "Apps may not use or disclose to third parties data gathered in the health, fitness, and medical research context for advertising or other use-based data mining purposes."

**Our Compliance**:
- ‚úÖ We only use health data for health management
- ‚úÖ No advertising or data mining
- ‚úÖ No third-party data sharing
- ‚úÖ Data stays on device and in user's control

## Competitor Analysis

### Oura Ring - "Symptom Radar"

**Terminology**:
- Feature name: "**Symptom Radar**" (not "Illness Detection")
- Levels: "No signs", "Minor signs", "Major signs"
- Key phrase: "**signs of strain on your body**"
- Action: Enable "**Rest Mode**" to pause activity goals

**Disclaimer** (verbatim from Oura):
> "The Oura Ring is not a medical device and is not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Please do not make any changes to your medication, daily routines, nutrition, sleep schedule, or workouts without first consulting your doctor or another medical professional."

**Metrics Monitored**:
- Skin temperature
- Respiratory rate
- Resting heart rate
- Heart rate variability
- Inactive time
- Age (demographic)

**Key Insights**:
1. Uses "strain" not "illness"
2. Focuses on "rest and recovery" recommendations
3. Comprehensive medical disclaimer
4. Launched in Oura Labs first (beta testing)
5. Can be toggled off by users

### Whoop - "Recovery" System

**Terminology**:
- Uses "**Recovery**" score (0-100%)
- "**Strain**" for workout intensity
- No explicit "illness detection" feature
- Focuses on "physiological stress"

**Approach**:
- Recovery score drops when body is stressed
- Recommends rest days based on recovery
- Never uses medical terminology
- Positions as performance optimization

### UltraHuman - "Recovery Score"

**Terminology**:
- "**Recovery Score**"
- "Glucose variability" (CGM-based)
- Focus on metabolic health

**Disclaimer**:
> "Always consult with a doctor or qualified healthcare professional about any health condition and/or concerns. Please do not disregard/delay seeking professional medical advice or treatment because of information read on or accessed through our products."

## Our Implementation - Compliance Review

### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT Elements

**1. Feature Naming**
```swift
// UI displays "Body Stress Signals" not "Illness Detection"
static let title = "Body Stress Signals"
static let subtitle = "Potential strain indicators"
```

**2. Medical Disclaimer** (matches Oura's standard)
```swift
static let notMedicalDiagnosis = "VeloReady is not a medical device and is not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease."

static let medicalDisclaimer = "Please do not make any changes to your medication, daily routines, nutrition, sleep schedule, or workouts without first consulting your doctor or another medical professional."
```

**3. Terminology**
- ‚úÖ "Body stress signals" (not "illness")
- ‚úÖ "Strain indicators" (not "symptoms")
- ‚úÖ "Unusual patterns" (not "diagnosis")
- ‚úÖ "Rest recommended" (not "treatment")

**4. Severity Levels** (similar to Oura)
```swift
enum Severity {
    case low = "Low"
    case moderate = "Moderate"
    case high = "High"
}
```

**5. Signal Types** (descriptive, not diagnostic)
- HRV Drop (not "cardiac issue")
- Elevated RHR (not "heart problem")
- Respiratory Change (not "lung disease")
- Sleep Disruption (not "sleep disorder")
- Activity Drop (not "fatigue syndrome")

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Internal Naming (OK - Not User-Facing)

**File Names** (internal only, not shown to users):
- `IllnessDetectionService.swift` ‚úÖ OK (internal)
- `IllnessIndicator.swift` ‚úÖ OK (internal)
- `IllnessIndicatorCard.swift` ‚úÖ OK (internal)
- `IllnessDetailSheet.swift` ‚úÖ OK (internal)

**Rationale**: Apple reviews user-facing content, not internal code naming. Competitors likely have similar internal naming.

### üì± User-Facing Content (All Compliant)

**Today View**:
- Card title: "Body Stress Signals" ‚úÖ
- Subtitle: "Potential strain indicators" ‚úÖ

**Detail Sheet**:
- Title: "Body Stress Signals" ‚úÖ
- Disclaimer: Full medical disclaimer ‚úÖ
- Recommendations: "Consider rest" not "treatment" ‚úÖ

**Debug Settings**:
- Toggle: "Show Illness Indicator" ‚ö†Ô∏è (Debug only, not in production)

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
1. Non-medical terminology in all UI
2. Comprehensive disclaimers matching Oura
3. Focus on "rest and recovery" not "treatment"
4. Educational/informational positioning
5. User can disable feature

### üìã Additional Safeguards (Optional)

**1. Add "Beta" or "Labs" Badge** (like Oura did)
```swift
// Optional: Add beta badge to feature
Text("Body Stress Signals")
Badge("BETA", variant: .info, size: .small)
```

**2. Opt-In on First Use**
```swift
// Show disclaimer and get user acknowledgment first time
if !UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "hasAcknowledgedBodyStressSignals") {
    // Show disclaimer sheet with "I Understand" button
}
```

**3. Add to Privacy Policy**
- Mention body stress signal detection
- Clarify it's not medical advice
- Explain data usage (on-device only)

**4. App Store Description**
Suggested wording:
> "**Body Stress Signals**: Monitor patterns in your health metrics that may indicate your body needs rest. VeloReady analyzes HRV, resting heart rate, sleep quality, and activity levels to help you optimize recovery. Not a medical device - always consult healthcare professionals for medical concerns."
