# Unified Data Source Architecture

## Overview
VeloReady now provides an **identical user experience** regardless of whether you use Intervals.icu or Strava as your data source. Both integrations share the same models, calculations, and features.

---

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- **All activity data** is converted to `IntervalsActivity` format internally
- **No duplicate conversion logic** - one converter utility handles all conversions
- **Same calculations** apply to both data sources (TSS, IF, CTL, ATL, zones)

### 2. Transparent Fallback
- App automatically uses Intervals.icu if authenticated
- Seamlessly falls back to Strava if Intervals not available
- User sees no difference in functionality

### 3. No Model Duplication
- Both sources feed into the same `IntervalsActivity` model
- All features work identically: ride detail, charts, strain, recovery, adaptive FTP
- Same UI components render both data sources

---

## Key Components

### `ActivityConverter` Utility
**Location:** `/Core/Utils/ActivityConverter.swift`

Single utility for converting external data sources to internal format:

```swift
// Convert single Strava activity
let activity = ActivityConverter.stravaToIntervals(stravaActivity)

// Convert batch
let activities = ActivityConverter.stravaToIntervals(stravaActivities)

// Enrich with calculated metrics (TSS, IF)
let enriched = ActivityConverter.enrichWithMetrics(activity, ftp: 250)
```

**Replaced 4 duplicate converters** in:
- ActivitiesView.swift
- UnifiedActivityCard.swift
- TrainingLoadChart.swift
- RideDetailViewModel.swift

### `UnifiedActivityService`
**Location:** `/Core/Services/UnifiedActivityService.swift`

Central service for fetching activities from any source:

```swift
// Automatically uses best available source
let activities = try await UnifiedActivityService.shared.fetchRecentActivities(limit: 100, daysBack: 90)

// Get today's activities
let todaysActivities = try await UnifiedActivityService.shared.fetchTodaysActivities()

// Get activities for specific purposes
let ftpActivities = try await UnifiedActivityService.shared.fetchActivitiesForFTP()
let loadActivities = try await UnifiedActivityService.shared.fetchActivitiesForTrainingLoad()
```

**Benefits:**
- One place to manage data source logic
- Consistent date filtering
- Unified error handling
- Easy to add new data sources in future

## Implementation Details

### TSS Calculation (When Not Provided by API)
```swift
// Used for Strava activities without TSS
let intensityFactor = normalizedPower / ftp
let tss = (duration / 3600) * intensityFactor * intensityFactor * 100
```

### CTL/ATL Calculation
```swift
// Both sources use same algorithm
CTL = Exponential weighted average (42-day)
ATL = Exponential weighted average (7-day)
TSB = CTL - ATL  // Form/freshness
```

### Virtual Ride Detection
```swift
// Works for both sources
let isVirtual = activity.type?.lowercased().contains("virtual") == true ||
                activity.type?.lowercased().contains("indoor") == true
```

## Future Enhancements

### Easy to Add New Data Sources
The architecture makes it trivial to add new sources:

1. Add converter to `ActivityConverter`:
   ```swift
   static func garminToIntervals(_ garmin: GarminActivity) -> IntervalsActivity
   ```

2. Add fetch logic to `UnifiedActivityService`:
   ```swift
   if garminAuth.isAuthenticated {
       return try await garminAPI.fetchActivities()
   }
   ```

3. Everything else works automatically!

### Potential Sources
- Garmin Connect
- Wahoo
- TrainingPeaks
- Golden Cheetah
- .fit file upload
