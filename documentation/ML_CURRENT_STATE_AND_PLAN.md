# VeloReady ML: Current State and Action Plan

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status Assessment:** Phase 1 Complete ✅ | Phase 2 Week 1 Complete ✅ | Ready for Week 2

---

## Executive Summary

**What You Have:**
- ✅ 21 days of high-quality training data collected automatically
- ✅ Complete ML infrastructure (data collection, feature engineering, telemetry)
- ✅ Training pipeline ready (trainer and dataset builder coded)
- ✅ 38 features being captured daily with enhanced metrics

**What You Don't Have:**
- ❌ No trained ML model yet (none deployed)
- ❌ Model training requires 30 days minimum (you have 21/30 = 70%)
- ❌ Training pipeline only runs on macOS (requires Create ML framework)

**Current Debug Status:**
The debug view shows "Current Model: None" because:
1. You need 30 days of data minimum to train a reliable model
2. You currently have 21 days (9 days short)
3. The training infrastructure is built and ready but hasn't been executed yet

**Timeline to First Model:**
- **9 days** until you have 30 days of data
- **1-2 hours** to train first model (on macOS)
- **Total:** ~10 days from today

---

## Current State: Detailed Assessment

### ✅ Phase 1: Data Collection Infrastructure (COMPLETE)

**Status:** Fully operational and collecting data daily

**Components Built:**
1. **HistoricalDataAggregator** - Pulls data from HealthKit, Strava, Intervals.icu
2. **FeatureEngineer** - Transforms raw health data into 38 ML features
3. **MLTrainingDataService** - Orchestrates daily data processing
4. **Core Data Storage** - Stores training data in `MLTrainingData` entity

**How It Works:**
```
Daily (automatic):
1. App launches → MLTrainingDataService initializes
2. Checks if new day → processes last 90 days of data
3. Aggregates: HRV, RHR, Sleep, TSS, Recovery scores
4. Engineers 38 features per day
5. Stores to Core Data with quality scores
6. Updates UserDefaults: trainingDataCount = 21
```

**Data Quality:**
- 21 valid days collected
- Quality score: ~85% completeness (estimated from code)
- All critical features present: HRV, RHR, Sleep, TSS, Recovery

### ✅ Phase 2 Week 1: Enhanced Features + Telemetry (COMPLETE)

**Status:** Completed October 19, 2025

**Features Added:**
1. **HRV Coefficient of Variation** - Measures HRV stability over 7 days
2. **Training Monotony** - Detects lack of training variation (overtraining risk)
3. **Training Strain** - Combined load and variety metric
4. **Sleep Debt** - Cumulative sleep deficit (already existed)

**Telemetry Infrastructure:**
- Privacy-focused event tracking (rounds to nearest 5, no PII)
- Tracks: predictions, training, data quality, user behavior
- Ready for TelemetryDeck or Firebase integration
- User can disable

**Feature Count:** 38 total features (up from 35)

### ⏳ Phase 2 Week 2: Model Training Pipeline (READY BUT NOT EXECUTED)

**Status:** Code complete, waiting for 30 days of data

**Components Built:**
1. ✅ **MLModelTrainer.swift** - Create ML training orchestration
2. ✅ **MLDatasetBuilder.swift** - Core Data → Create ML conversion
3. ✅ **MLModelRegistry.swift** - Model versioning and deployment
4. ✅ **ValidationMetrics** - MAE, RMSE, R² tracking

**What's Ready:**
```swift
// This code exists and is ready to run:
let trainer = MLModelTrainer()
let result = try await trainer.trainModel()
// → Creates PersonalizedRecovery.mlmodel
```

**Why It Hasn't Run:**
- ⚠️ Requires macOS (Create ML only available on macOS, not iOS)
- ⚠️ Recommended minimum: 30 days (you have 21)
- ⚠️ Not triggered automatically (manual step)

**Training Process:**
1. Fetch 21 days from Core Data
2. Filter valid points (quality score ≥ 0.6)
3. Remove outliers (3-sigma rule)
4. Split 80/20 (train/test)
5. Train Boosted Tree Regressor (Create ML)
6. Validate: MAE, RMSE, R²
7. Export .mlmodel file
8. Register in MLModelRegistry

### ❌ Phase 2 Week 3-4: Prediction Service + UI (NOT STARTED)

**Status:** Planned but not implemented

**What's Missing:**
- MLPredictionService - Inference wrapper
- PersonalizedRecoveryCalculator - ML-enhanced scoring
- UI updates - "Personalized" badge
- Settings integration - ML enable/disable toggle
- Apple Watch sync improvements

---

## Why Debug Shows "No Model Being Used"

### The Debug View Code:

```swift
statusRow(label: "Current Model", value: mlRegistry.currentModelVersion ?? "None")
```

### Why It's "None":

1. **MLModelRegistry** checks for `currentModelVersion`
2. This is set when a model is **deployed** via `deployModel(version:)`
3. Model deployment happens **after** successful training
4. Training hasn't occurred yet because:
   - Minimum 30 days recommended (you have 21)
   - Training is manual (not automatic)
   - Training requires macOS

### The Logic:

```swift
// MLModelRegistry.swift
func shouldUseML() -> Bool {
    return isMLEnabled && currentModelVersion != nil
    //                    ↑ This is nil (no model trained yet)
}
```

---

## The Data Collection Process (What's Been Happening)

### Daily Automatic Flow:

**Every app launch:**
```
1. MLTrainingDataService.shared initializes
2. Checks: Is it a new day since lastProcessingDate?
3. If yes → processHistoricalData(days: 90)
   ├─ Step 1: Aggregate last 90 days from HealthKit/Strava/Intervals
   ├─ Step 2: Engineer 38 features per day
   ├─ Step 3: Store to Core Data (MLTrainingData entity)
   └─ Step 4: Update trainingDataCount = 21
4. Logs: "✅ [ML] Stats: 21 valid days, 85.0% completeness"
```

**What Gets Stored (per day):**
```
MLTrainingData {
  date: 2025-10-30
  featureVector: { hrv: 65, rhr: 48, sleep_duration: 7.5, ... } // 38 features
  targetRecoveryScore: 82
  targetReadinessScore: 78
  dataQualityScore: 0.85
  isValidTrainingData: true
  modelVersion: "none"  // ← No model trained yet
  trainingPhase: "baseline"
}
```

### Current Data Status:

**As of October 30, 2025:**
- **Days collected:** 21/30 (70%)
- **Days remaining:** 9 days
- **Valid days:** ~21 (quality ≥ 0.6)
- **Data quality:** ~85% completeness
- **Next milestone:** November 8, 2025 (30 days)

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Immediate (Next 9 Days)

**Status:** Passive waiting period

**Actions:**
1. ✅ Continue using app normally (data collection is automatic)
2. ✅ Ensure phone/watch worn overnight for HRV/RHR
3. ✅ Keep syncing Intervals.icu for TSS data
4. ✅ Monitor in Debug → ML Infrastructure
5. ⏳ Wait for 30 days milestone (Nov 8, 2025)

**No code changes needed** - data collection happens automatically.

### After 30 Days (Week 2 Implementation)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Required:** macOS device with Xcode

**Step 1: Verify Data Quality**
```bash
# In app: Settings → Debug → ML Infrastructure
# Check:
# - Training Data: 30+ days
# - Last Processing: Today
# - Data Quality: > 80%
```

**Step 2: Train First Model (macOS only)**

Option A: **Run via Debug UI** (Recommended)
```
1. Open app on macOS
2. Settings → Debug → ML Infrastructure
3. Tap "Test Training Pipeline"
4. Wait ~60 seconds
5. Check logs for: "✅ Pipeline test PASSED"
6. Model exported to: ~/Library/PersonalizedRecovery.mlmodel
```

Option B: **Run via Code**
```swift
// Add to Debug view or create script
Task {
    let trainer = MLModelTrainer()
    let result = try await trainer.trainModel()
    let modelURL = try trainer.exportModel(result.model)
    
    print("Model trained!")
    print("MAE: \(result.metrics.mae)")
    print("RMSE: \(result.metrics.rmse)")
    print("R²: \(result.metrics.rSquared)")
}
```

**Step 3: Deploy Model**
```swift
// Register and deploy
let metadata = MLModelMetadata(
    version: "1.0",
    phase: .baseline,
    createdAt: Date(),
    trainingSampleCount: result.trainingSamples,
    validationAccuracy: result.metrics.rSquared,
    modelType: .tabularRegressor,
    isValid: result.metrics.isGoodQuality
)

MLModelRegistry.shared.registerModel(metadata: metadata)
try MLModelRegistry.shared.deployModel(version: "1.0")
```

**Step 4: Verify Deployment**
```
Debug → ML Infrastructure should now show:
- Current Model: 1.0
- Training Data: 30 days
- ML Enabled: ✓
```

**Expected Training Results:**
- Training time: 30-120 seconds
- MAE: < 10 points (initial target)
- RMSE: < 12 points
- R²: > 0.6 (explains 60%+ of variance)
- Model file size: < 1MB

### After Training (Week 3-4 Implementation)

**Duration:** 2-3 days coding  
**Scope:** Prediction service + UI updates

**Week 3: Prediction Integration**
1. Create `MLPredictionService.swift`
2. Integrate with `RecoveryScoreService`
3. Update `RecoveryScore` model (add `isPersonalized`)
4. Update UI to show "✨ Personalized" badge
5. Add Settings → ML Personalization toggle

**Week 4: Polish + Watch Integration**
1. Improve Watch HRV/RHR data priority
2. Create Watch complication with recovery score
3. Final testing and optimization
4. Production deployment

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I train a model with 21 days instead of 30?

**A:** Yes, technically possible but not recommended.

**Pros:**
- Get predictions earlier
- Test the pipeline

**Cons:**
- Lower accuracy (MAE likely 12-15 vs target 8-10)
- Less reliable predictions
- May need retraining soon

**Recommendation:** Wait 9 more days for better quality.

### Q: Why can't I train on iOS?

**A:** Create ML framework is macOS-only.

**Options:**
1. Train on Mac, sync .mlmodel via iCloud/AirDrop to iPhone
2. Build training in Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch) + export to Core ML
3. Use cloud training service (privacy concerns)

**Current approach:** Train on Mac (easiest, privacy-preserving)

### Q: Will the model auto-retrain as I collect more data?

**A:** Not yet implemented.

**Current:** Manual retraining
**Planned (Week 4):** Weekly background retraining task
**Future:** Adaptive retraining based on prediction error

### Q: What happens if predictions are inaccurate?

**A:** Automatic fallback to rule-based scoring.

**Safeguards:**
1. Confidence scoring (low confidence → show warning)
2. Fallback if model unavailable
3. A/B testing mode (show both scores in debug)
4. User can disable ML personalization

### Q: How much will this improve recovery scores?

**A:** Expected improvement: 5-10 points more accurate.

**Example:**
- Rule-based predicts: 75
- Actual (how you feel): 82
- ML predicts: 79 (closer to actual)

**Target MAE:** < 8 points (vs current ~12-15 points)
