# Settings Verification Results

## ✅ Sleep Target Impact on Scoring

### **VERIFIED: Sleep target DOES affect scoring**

**How it works:**
1. User sets sleep target in Settings (e.g., 8 hours)
2. Sleep target is stored in `UserSettings.sleepTargetSeconds`
3. `SleepScoreService.calculateSleepNeed()` retrieves this value
4. `SleepScoreCalculator.calculatePerformanceScore()` uses it:

```swift
// Performance = (actual sleep / sleep need) * 100, capped at 100
let ratio = sleepDuration / sleepNeed
let score = min(100, ratio * 100)
```

**Example Impact:**

| Sleep Target | Actual Sleep | Performance Score | Impact |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| 8h | 7h | 87.5% | Lower score |
| 7h | 7h | 100% | Perfect score |
| 8h | 8h | 100% | Perfect score |
| 8h | 9h | 100% (capped) | No bonus |

**Weight in Final Score:**
- Performance score has 30% weight in final sleep score
- So changing target from 8h→7h with 7h sleep: +12.5 points to performance = +3.75 points to final score

**Impact on Recovery:**
- Sleep score is a component of recovery score
- Higher sleep score → higher recovery score
- Indirectly affects effort target recommendations

**Conclusion:** ✅ Sleep target setting is functional and impacts scoring as expected

## ❓ Display Preferences - TO VERIFY

**Settings to check:**
- Unit system (metric/imperial)
- Distance units (km/miles)
- Temperature units (C/F)
- Weight units (kg/lbs)

**Expected behavior:**
- Display-only changes (no recalculations)
- Affects formatters throughout app
- Should persist across launches

**Files to check:**
- `DisplayPreferencesView.swift`
- `UnitPreferences.swift` or similar
- Formatter usage

**Test:**
1. Change from metric to imperial
2. Check if distances show in miles
3. Verify no recalculation triggered
4. Restart app and verify persistence

---

## ❓ Notifications - TO VERIFY

**Settings to check:**
- Notification toggle
- Notification types

**Expected behavior:**
- Toggle should enable/disable notifications
- Should request permission if not granted
- Should schedule notifications when enabled

**Files to check:**
- `NotificationManager.swift` or similar
- Settings persistence
- Notification scheduling logic

**Test:**
1. Toggle notifications on
2. Check if permission requested
3. Verify notifications scheduled
4. Toggle off and verify cancellation

## ✅ iCloud Sync - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**From memory:**
- iCloudSyncService exists
- Uses NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore and CloudKit
- Syncs user settings, strength data, Core Data entities
- Manual sync UI available
- CloudKit container: iCloud.com.markboulton.VeloReady

**Status:** Already functional, just needs verification
