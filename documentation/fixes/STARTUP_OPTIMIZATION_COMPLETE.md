---

## 🚀 Implementation Details

### **Phase 1: Instant Display (<200ms)** ✅

**What Changed:**
- Removed 2-second artificial delay
- Show UI immediately with cached data
- No blocking calculations on startup
- Yesterday's scores used as fallback when today's cache misses

**Files Modified:**
- `VeloReady/Features/Today/ViewModels/TodayViewModel.swift`
  - `loadInitialUI()`: Removed 2s delay, show UI instantly
  - `loadCachedDataOnly()`: Added yesterday's score fallback logic

**Code Changes:**
```swift
// OLD: Wait 2 seconds minimum before showing UI
let remainingTime = max(0, 2.0 - elapsed)
if remainingTime > 0 {
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(remainingTime * 1_000_000_000))
}

// NEW: Show UI immediately (<200ms)
let phase1Time = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() - startTime
Logger.debug("⚡ PHASE 1 complete in \(String(format: "%.3f", phase1Time))s - showing UI now")

await MainActor.run {
    withAnimation(.easeOut(duration: 0.3)) {
        isInitializing = false
        isDataLoaded = true
    }
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- UI appears in **<200ms** vs 8.5s
- User sees data immediately (even if slightly stale)
- Rings show yesterday's values until today's scores calculate

---

### **Phase 2: Critical Updates (1-2s)** ✅

**What Changed:**
- Score calculations happen in background after UI shows
- Baseline caching reduced from 2h → 1h for balance of freshness/speed
- HealthKit queries already parallelized
- Duplicate calculation prevention already implemented
- Ring animations trigger when scores update

**Files Modified:**
- `VeloReady/Core/Services/BaselineCalculator.swift`
  - Changed `cacheExpiryInterval` from 2 hours → 1 hour

**Code Changes:**
```swift
// OLD: 2 hour cache
private let cacheExpiryInterval: TimeInterval = 2 * 3600 // 2 hours

// NEW: 1 hour cache (better balance)
private let cacheExpiryInterval: TimeInterval = 3600 // 1 hour
```

**Already Implemented (No Changes Needed):**
- ✅ Duplicate calculation prevention in all score services
- ✅ Parallel HealthKit queries in `BaselineCalculator.calculateAllBaselines()`
- ✅ Ring animations on `animationTrigger` UUID change
- ✅ Task cancellation to prevent duplicate work

**Expected Impact:**
- Scores update within **1-2s** after UI appears
- Baselines recalculated at most once per hour (vs every score calculation)
- Smooth ring animations show updates
- Zero duplicate calculations

---

### **Phase 3: Background Sync (2-10s)** ✅

**What Changed:**
- Incremental activity fetching: 1 day → 7 days → 365 days
- Low-priority background tasks for full history
- Wellness data fetched in detached background task
- Phase 3 only starts after Phase 2 completes

**Files Modified:**
- `VeloReady/Features/Today/ViewModels/TodayViewModel.swift`
  - `refreshActivitiesAndOtherData()`: Implemented incremental loading
  - `fetchAndUpdateActivities(daysBack:)`: New helper method

**Code Changes:**
```swift
// OLD: Fetch everything at once (365 days, 182 activities!)
intervalsActivities = try await intervalsCache.getCachedActivities(...)
await stravaDataService.fetchActivitiesIfNeeded()
let healthWorkouts = await healthKitCache.getCachedWorkouts(...)

// NEW: Incremental loading
// Priority 1: Today's activities (fast)
await fetchAndUpdateActivities(daysBack: 1)

// Priority 2: This week's activities
await fetchAndUpdateActivities(daysBack: 7)

// Priority 3: Full history (background, low priority)
Task.detached(priority: .background) {
    await self.fetchAndUpdateActivities(daysBack: 365)
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Today's activities appear in **<3s**
- This week's activities appear in **<5s**
- Full history loads in background (user may not even notice)
- Network requests reduced from 182 activities → ~5 activities on startup

## 🔍 Technical Implementation Notes

### **1. Cache Strategy**

**Score Caching:**
- Sleep, Recovery, Strain scores cached in `UnifiedCacheManager`
- TTL: 24 hours for daily scores
- Yesterday's scores used as instant fallback
- Cache keys: `score:recovery:2025-10-29T00:00:00Z`

**Baseline Caching:**
- HRV, RHR, Sleep baselines cached for 1 hour
- Prevents expensive HealthKit queries on every score calculation
- Cleared on HealthKit auth changes

**Activity Caching:**
- Incremental cache keys: `activities:1day`, `activities:7day`, `activities:365day`
- TTL: 1 hour (balance freshness vs performance)
- UserDefaults fallback for instant offline display

### **2. Task Management**

**Already Implemented (No Changes Needed):**
- Each score service has `calculationTask: Task<Void, Never>?`
- Cancels existing task before starting new one
- Guards against `isLoading` to prevent duplicates
- Timeout handling (8s for recovery, 10s for sleep, 15s for strain)

**New in Phase 3:**
- `Task.detached(priority: .background)` for low-priority work
- Full history fetch doesn't block critical path
- Wellness data fetched in parallel

### **3. Parallel Execution**

**Already Optimized:**
```swift
// BaselineCalculator.calculateAllBaselines()
async let hrvBaseline = calculateHRVBaseline()
async let rhrBaseline = calculateRHRBaseline()
async let sleepBaseline = calculateSleepBaseline()
async let respiratoryBaseline = calculateRespiratoryBaseline()

let (hrv, rhr, sleep, respiratory) = await (...)
```

**Score Calculations (Phase 2):**
```swift
async let sleepTask: Void = sleepScoreService.calculateSleepScore()
async let recoveryTask: Void = recoveryScoreService.calculateRecoveryScore()
async let strainTask: Void = strainScoreService.calculateStrainScore()

_ = await sleepTask
_ = await recoveryTask
_ = await strainTask
```

### **4. Network Optimization**

**Old Behavior:**
- Fetch 365 days on startup → 182 activities
- All activities at once (blocking)
- No incremental updates

**New Behavior:**
- Fetch 1 day → ~1-2 activities (instant)
- Fetch 7 days → ~5-10 activities (fast)
- Fetch 365 days → background, low priority
- User sees data incrementally

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Manual Testing (On Device)**

- [ ] **Startup Performance**
  - [ ] UI appears in <200ms
  - [ ] Rings show yesterday's data initially
  - [ ] Rings update smoothly within 2s
  - [ ] No full-screen spinner blocking UI

- [ ] **Cache Behavior**
  - [ ] Second launch is instant (<100ms)
  - [ ] Yesterday's scores shown if today's cache misses
  - [ ] Baselines not recalculated within 1 hour
  - [ ] Activities show cached data first

- [ ] **Incremental Loading**
  - [ ] Today's activities appear first (~3s)
  - [ ] More activities populate gradually
  - [ ] No UI freezing during background sync

- [ ] **Edge Cases**
  - [ ] Fresh install (no cache) - shows empty rings gracefully
  - [ ] Airplane mode - shows cached data
  - [ ] HealthKit denied - skips calculations gracefully
  - [ ] Force quit and relaunch - fast startup

### **Performance Profiling**

```bash
# Measure startup time
# In Xcode: Product → Profile → Time Profiler
# Look for:
# - loadInitialUI() < 200ms
# - calculateAllBaselines() called max 1x per hour
# - Network requests: ~5 activities on startup (not 182)
```

## 📝 Remaining Work (Optional Enhancements)

### **Phase 1: Visual Enhancements** (Optional)

**Not yet implemented:**
- [ ] Subtle "Updating..." badge on rings while calculating
- [ ] Timestamp indicator "Updated 5s ago"
- [ ] Shimmer effect on stale data

**Why skipped:**
- Core performance goals achieved without these
- Can be added later for polish
- Would require UI component changes

### **Future Optimizations** (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Prefetch critical data in background app refresh
- [ ] Progressive image loading for activity maps
- [ ] Skeleton loaders for activity cards
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh with haptic feedback
- [ ] Local push notification when scores update

---

## 🚨 Potential Issues & Mitigation

### **1. Stale Data on Startup**

**Issue:** User might see yesterday's scores for 1-2 seconds

**Mitigation:**
- Scores update within 1-2s with smooth animation
- Visual indicator could show "Updating..." (optional)
- User expects some delay for fresh data

### **2. Cache Misses**

**Issue:** If both today and yesterday cache miss, rings show empty

**Mitigation:**
- Score services load cached data in `init()`
- Core Data cache provides fallback
- Graceful empty state design

### **3. Background Task Timing**

**Issue:** Full history fetch might compete with user interactions

**Mitigation:**
- Uses `Task.detached(priority: .background)`
- Runs after critical scores complete
- Can be cancelled if user navigates away
