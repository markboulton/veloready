## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### Bugs Fixed (Commit 1: 969af3c)

#### 1. ‚úÖ ML Progress Bar Not Auto-Updating
**Problem:** ML training data count showed stale data until manual refresh in debug settings.

**Solution:**
- Added `.todayDataRefreshed` notification to `VeloReadyApp.swift`
- `AIBriefView` listens for notification and calls `mlService.refreshTrainingDataCount()`
- `TodayViewModel` posts notification after data refresh completes
- Progress bar now updates automatically when new ML data is processed

**Files:** `AIBriefView.swift`, `TodayViewModel.swift`, `VeloReadyApp.swift`

#### 2. ‚úÖ Loader Not Centered on First App Open
**Problem:** Loading spinner appeared at screen center, causing jarring transition when compact rings loaded at top.

**Solution:**
- Modified `LoadingOverlay.swift` to position loader ~140pt from top
- Aligns with compact rings position for smooth transition
- No more layout jump on first load

**File:** `LoadingOverlay.swift`

#### 3. ‚úÖ Hidden Cards Feature
**Problem:** No way to hide unwanted cards from Today page.

**Solution:**
- Added `hiddenSections` array to `TodaySectionOrder`
- `TodaySectionOrderView` now shows two sections: "Visible" and "Hidden"
- Eye/eye.slash buttons to move cards between sections
- `TodayView` filters out hidden sections when rendering
- Fully persistent via UserDefaults and iCloud sync

**Files:** `TodaySectionOrder.swift`, `TodaySectionOrderView.swift`, `TodayView.swift`

### Features Added (Commit 2: d225eff)

#### 4. ‚ú® Performance Overview Chart
**What:** 7-day chart overlaying Recovery, Training Load (TSS), and Sleep scores.

**Implementation:**
- Uses existing `PerformanceOverviewCardV2` component
- New `.performanceChart` section in `TodaySection` enum
- Fetches real data from Core Data (`DailyScores` + `DailyLoad`)
- Background data loading via `fetchChartData()` in `TodayViewModel`
- Movable, hideable, and requires Pro access
- Shows Pro upgrade card for free users

**Data Flow:**
```
TodayViewModel.refreshActivitiesAndOtherData()
  ‚Üí fetchChartData() (background Task)
    ‚Üí Fetch from Core Data (DailyScores)
      ‚Üí Convert to TrendDataPoint
        ‚Üí Update @Published properties
          ‚Üí PerformanceOverviewCardV2 renders
```

**Files:** `TodaySection.swift`, `TodayViewModel.swift`, `TodayView.swift`

#### 5. ‚ú® Training Form Chart (CTL/ATL/TSB)
**What:** Chart showing fitness (CTL), fatigue (ATL), and form (TSB) trends.

**Implementation:**
- New `FormChartCardV2.swift` component
- Complete chart with legends, empty states, and previews
- Uses Swift Charts with line marks
- CTL (blue), ATL (red), TSB (green dashed)
- Fetches from `DailyLoad.ctl`, `DailyLoad.atl`, `DailyLoad.tsb`
- Also movable, hideable, and Pro-gated

**Features:**
- Proper empty state with explanation of metrics
- Chart axes with date formatting
- Visual legend with color coding
- Responsive to data availability

**Files:** `FormChartCardV2.swift`, `TodaySection.swift`, `TodayViewModel.swift`, `TodayView.swift`

#### 6. ‚ú® Customize View CTA
**What:** Call-to-action button at bottom of Today page.

**Implementation:**
- New `CustomizeViewCTA.swift` component
- Prominent button: "Customize This View"
- Subtitle: "Reorder cards or hide sections you don't need"
- Navigation to `TodaySectionOrderView` settings
- Clean design with icon and chevron

**Design:**

- ‚ùå ML progress never updated without debug refresh
- ‚ùå Layout jump on first app open (loader ‚Üí rings)
- ‚ùå No way to hide unwanted cards
- ‚ùå No performance charts on Today page
- ‚ùå No training form visualization
- ‚ùå Users didn't know cards were customizable

### After

- ‚úÖ Smooth, centered loader transition
- ‚úÖ Full card customization (reorder + hide)
- ‚úÖ 7-day performance overview chart (Pro)
- ‚úÖ CTL/ATL/TSB form chart (Pro)
- ‚úÖ Clear CTA to customize view

## üé® Design Decisions

### Pro Feature Gating
Both new charts require Pro access:
- Shows value of Pro subscription
- Encourages upgrades for power users
- Free users see upgrade card with benefits
- Charts are substantial value-add features

### Data Source
Used Core Data instead of live calculation:
- Much faster (cached data)
- Consistent with Trends page
- No API rate limit concerns
- Works offline

### Customization Philosophy
"Progressive disclosure":
1. Default order shows most useful cards first
2. Advanced users can reorder via drag
3. Power users can hide unused cards
4. CTA at bottom reminds users of customization

### Chart Time Range
Using 7 days (via `.days30` enum):
- Enough data for trends
- Not overwhelming
- Matches performance card
- Can be adjusted later

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

### Chart Improvements
- [ ] Add time range selector (7d/30d/90d)
- [ ] Tap to expand chart to full screen
- [ ] Add annotations for key events

### Customization Enhancements
