# Adaptive Zones Implementation - Changes Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Testing

---

## ✅ **Completed Changes**

### **1. Enhanced Settings Display Logging**

**File:** `/Features/Settings/Views/AthleteZonesSettingsView.swift`

**Changes:**
- Added `.onAppear` logging to show current zone state
- Logs FTP, Max HR, zone counts, and actual zone values
- Helps diagnose display issues

**Log Output:**
```
🎯 [Zones] Settings View Appeared
   FTP: 210W
   FTP Source: computed
   Power Zones: 7 zones
   Power Zone Values: [0, 115, 158, 189, 221, 252, 316]
   Max HR: 179bpm
   HR Source: computed
   HR Zones: 7 zones
   HR Zone Values: [0, 122, 148, 157, 168, 174, 179]
```

### **2. Pro-Based Data Fetch Limits**

**File:** `/Core/Services/UnifiedActivityService.swift`

**Changes:**
- Added `ProFeatureConfig` integration
- Implemented tier-based limits:
  - **Free:** 90 days max
  - **Pro:** 365 days max
- Updated `fetchRecentActivities()` to cap requests
- Updated `fetchActivitiesForFTP()` to request max days for tier
- Enhanced logging with tier information

**Key Code:**
```swift
private var maxDaysForFree: Int { 90 }
private var maxDaysForPro: Int { 365 }

func fetchRecentActivities(limit: Int = 100, daysBack: Int = 90) async throws -> [IntervalsActivity] {
    // Apply subscription-based limits
    let maxDays = proConfig.hasProAccess ? maxDaysForPro : maxDaysForFree
    let actualDays = min(daysBack, maxDays)
    
    Logger.data("📊 [Activities] Fetch request: \(daysBack) days (capped to \(actualDays) for \(proConfig.hasProAccess ? "PRO" : "FREE") tier)")
    // ...
}
```

**Log Output:**
```
📊 [Activities] Fetch request: 365 days (capped to 365 for PRO tier)
📊 [FTP] Fetching activities for FTP computation (365 days)
✅ [FTP] Found 150 activities with power data
```

### **3. Updated Zone Computation**

**File:** `/Core/Models/AthleteProfile.swift`

**Changes:**
- Removed hardcoded 120-day filter
- Now uses all activities passed in (pre-filtered by caller)
- Updated documentation to reflect tier-based filtering
- Enhanced logging

**Before:**
```swift
let oneTwentyDaysAgo = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -120, to: Date())!
let recentActivities = activities.filter { activity in
    guard let date = parseDate(from: activity.startDateLocal) else { return false }
    return date >= oneTwentyDaysAgo
}
```

**After:**
```swift
// Use all activities passed in (already filtered by caller based on subscription tier)
let recentActivities = activities
Logger.data("Processing \(recentActivities.count) activities for zone computation")
```

---

### **4. Centralized Activity Fetching**

**File:** `/Core/Data/CacheManager.swift`

**Changes:**
- Replaced direct API calls with `UnifiedActivityService.shared.fetchActivitiesForFTP()`
- Simplified code (removed duplicate Strava/Intervals logic)
- Made zone computation run in background (non-blocking)
- Enhanced logging

**Before:**
```swift
if oauthManager.isAuthenticated {
    activities = try await intervalsAPI.fetchRecentActivities(limit: 300, daysBack: 120)
} else {
    let stravaActivities = try await StravaAPIClient.shared.fetchActivities(perPage: 200)
    activities = ActivityConverter.stravaToIntervals(stravaActivities)
}

Task { @MainActor in
    await AthleteProfileManager.shared.computeFromActivities(activities)
}
```

**After:**
```swift
activities = try await UnifiedActivityService.shared.fetchActivitiesForFTP()

Task.detached(priority: .background) { @MainActor in
    Logger.data("🎯 [Zones] Starting background zone computation with \(activities.count) activities")
    await AthleteProfileManager.shared.computeFromActivities(activities)
    Logger.data("✅ [Zones] Background zone computation complete")
}
```

---

### **5. Updated Manual Recomputation**

**File:** `/Features/Settings/Views/AthleteZonesSettingsView.swift`

**Changes:**
- Replaced manual Intervals/Strava logic with unified service
- Simplified code significantly
- Enhanced logging

**Before:**
```swift
if IntervalsOAuthManager.shared.isAuthenticated {
    activities = try await intervalsAPIClient.fetchRecentActivities(limit: 300, daysBack: 120)
} else {
    let stravaActivities = try await StravaAPIClient.shared.fetchActivities(perPage: 200)
    activities = ActivityConverter.stravaToIntervals(stravaActivities)
}
```

**After:**
```swift
let activities = try await UnifiedActivityService.shared.fetchActivitiesForFTP()
```

## 🎯 **Feature Parity Achieved**

### **Strava Users:**
✅ Fetch up to 90 days (Free) or 365 days (Pro)  
✅ Activities converted to unified format  
✅ Zones computed using same algorithm  
✅ Background computation (non-blocking)

### **Intervals.icu Users:**
✅ Fetch up to 90 days (Free) or 365 days (Pro)  
✅ Native format used  
✅ Zones computed using same algorithm  
✅ Background computation (non-blocking)

### **Both Sources:**
✅ Identical computation logic  
✅ Identical zone generation  
✅ Identical logging  
✅ Identical user experience

Processing 150 activities for zone computation
✅ [Zones] Background zone computation complete
```

### **Settings View:**
```
🎯 [Zones] Settings View Appeared
   FTP: 210W
   Power Zones: 7 zones
   Power Zone Values: [0, 115, 158, 189, 221, 252, 316]
```
