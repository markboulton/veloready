# Strain/Load Calculation Improvements

## Overview
Comprehensive improvements to the strain calculation algorithm based on peer-reviewed sports science research. These changes make the calculation more intelligent, granular, and physiologically accurate by better utilizing available data and accounting for the true systemic fatigue from different training modalities.

## Research Foundation

### Key Papers Referenced
1. **Session-RPE Method** (Haddad et al., 2017) - PMC5673663
   - Validated RPE × duration for training load monitoring
   - Independent of cardiovascular response
   - Captures "sense of effort" from central nervous system

2. **Neuromuscular Fatigue After Heavy Resistance Training** (Thomas et al., 2018) - PMID:30067591
   - Heavy resistance (80% 1RM): 72h recovery needed
   - Muscle function decrements persist 48-72h
   - NOT primarily CNS fatigue - peripheral muscle damage + inflammation

3. **Concurrent Training Interference Effect** (Murach & Bagley, 2016) - PMID:24728927
   - Endurance + strength in same period can impair adaptations
   - <3h between modes = significant interference
   - Molecular pathways inhibit protein synthesis

4. **DOMS & Performance** (Cheung et al., 2003) - PMID:12617692
   - Eccentric exercises cause most damage
   - Peak soreness 24-72h post-exercise
   - Reduce intensity 1-2 days post-DOMS work

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Active Calories Integration ✅
**Problem**: Active calories collected but barely used in calculation.

**Solution**: Use as primary signal when workout data is limited or missing.

```swift
// Intelligent calorie-based TRIMP estimation
let estimatedMinutes = activeCalories / 7.5  // Assume moderate-vigorous mix
let calorieBasedTRIMP = estimatedMinutes * 0.6

// Blend with step-based estimate, use higher value
dailyActivityAdjustment = max(calorieBasedTRIMP, stepBasedTRIMP)
```

**Impact**: 
- Better strain detection on non-workout days
- Captures yard work, playing with kids, manual labor
- More accurate for users who don't formally "exercise"

### 2. Step-Calorie Intelligent Blending ✅
**Problem**: Steps and calories treated separately, missing the relationship.

**Solution**: Detect high-intensity activity by comparing actual vs expected calories.

```swift
let expectedCaloriesFromSteps = Double(steps) * 0.04  // ~0.04 cal/step
let intensityRatio = actualCalories / expectedCaloriesFromSteps

if intensityRatio > 1.5 {
    // High intensity beyond just walking
    let bonusStrain = min(2.0, (intensityRatio - 1.0) * 1.5)
    dailyActivityAdjustment += bonusStrain
}
```

**Impact**:
- Captures intense yard work, carrying groceries, stairs
- Differentiates walking from vigorous activity
- More granular daily activity tracking

### 3. Workout Type Differentiation ✅
**Problem**: All workouts treated equally regardless of type.

**Solution**: Apply research-backed metabolic cost multipliers.

```swift
let activityMultiplier: Double
switch workout.workoutActivityType {
case .running:     activityMultiplier = 1.2  // Higher impact than cycling
case .cycling:     activityMultiplier = 1.0  // Baseline
case .swimming:    activityMultiplier = 1.3  // Full body, very demanding
case .walking:     activityMultiplier = 0.6  // Lower intensity
case .hiking:      activityMultiplier = 0.9  // Moderate
default:           activityMultiplier = 1.0
}
```

**Impact**:
- Running shows higher strain than cycling for same HR
- Swimming properly recognized as highly demanding
- Walking contributes appropriately without inflating score

### 4. Muscle Group Tracking for Strength ✅
**Problem**: All strength work treated the same, ignoring recovery time differences.

**Solution**: Track which muscle groups were trained and their recovery needs.

```swift
enum MuscleGroup {
    case legs, back, chest, shoulders, arms, core
    
    var baseRecoveryTime: TimeInterval {
        switch self {
        case .legs: return 72 * 3600  // 72h - largest muscle groups
        case .back: return 48 * 3600  // 48h
        case .chest: return 48 * 3600  // 48h
        default: return 36 * 3600     // 36h
        }
    }
}
```

**Impact**:
- Heavy leg day properly shows 72h recovery need
- Arm work shows appropriate 36h recovery
- Residual fatigue from previous days factored in

### 5. RPE-Based Load with Recovery Decay ✅
**Problem**: Strength fatigue only counted on workout day, ignored residual impact.

**Solution**: Exponential decay curve based on muscle group recovery time.

```swift
func calculateStrengthLoadImpact(
    session: StrengthSession, 
    hoursSinceSession: Double
) -> Double {
    let baseLoad = session.rpe * session.duration
    let muscleGroupFactor = session.muscleGroups.contains(.legs) ? 1.5 : 1.0
    let acuteLoad = baseLoad * muscleGroupFactor
    
    // Exponential decay (most fatigue at 24-48h)
    let recoveryTime = 72 * 3600  // 72h for legs
    let decayFactor = exp(-hoursSinceSession / recoveryTime)
    
    return acuteLoad * decayFactor * 0.15
}
```

**Impact**:
- Heavy squat session impacts strain for 2-3 days
- Peak impact at 24-48h (when DOMS peaks)
- Properly accounts for systemic fatigue

### 6. Concurrent Training Interference ✅
**Problem**: Strength + cardio same day not recognized as additional stress.

**Solution**: Apply research-backed interference penalty based on recovery time.

```swift
func calculateConcurrentInterference(
    cardioTRIMP: Double,
    strengthLoad: Double,
    timeBetweenSessions: TimeInterval
) -> Double {
    let interferenceFactor: Double
    if timeBetweenSessions < 3 * 3600 {
        interferenceFactor = 1.25  // 25% penalty
    } else if timeBetweenSessions < 6 * 3600 {
        interferenceFactor = 1.10  // 10% penalty
    } else {
        interferenceFactor = 1.0   // No penalty
    }
    
    return (cardioTRIMP + strengthLoad) * interferenceFactor
}
```

**Impact**:
- Bike ride after leg day shows increased strain
- Proper recovery time between modes encouraged
- Molecular interference effect recognized

### 7. Recovery-Adjusted Perception ✅
**Problem**: Poor recovery makes everything harder, not reflected in calculation.

**Solution**: Amplify daily activity when recovery is compromised.

```swift
func amplifyDailyActivityByRecovery(
    dailyActivity: Double,
    recoveryFactor: Double
) -> Double {
    if recoveryFactor < 0.95 {
        // Poor recovery makes daily activity feel harder
        let amplification = 1.0 + (0.95 - recoveryFactor) * 2.0
        return dailyActivity * amplification
    }
    return dailyActivity
}
```

**Impact**:
- Walking 5000 steps feels harder after poor sleep
- Physiologically accurate perception modeling
- Better reflects true systemic stress
