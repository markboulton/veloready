# üö® REBUILD REQUIRED - Critical Fixes Not Applied

## **Why Charts Show No Data:**

You're running an **old build** with the infinite render loop bug. The charts are:
1. Calling `getData()` 100+ times per render
2. Never actually loading data into `@State`
3. Showing empty because `data = []` initially

## **Fixes Already in Code (Not in Your Build):**

### ‚úÖ **Commit 5ff4681** - HRV Chart Fixed
- Changed computed property to `@State var data`
- Added `loadData()` in `.onAppear` and `.onChange`
- **Result:** Chart will load once, not 100+ times

### ‚úÖ **Commit 995296a** - Recovery/Sleep Charts Fixed
- Same fix for `TrendChart` component
- **Result:** All trend charts will work

### ‚úÖ **Commit 7de359a** - UserDefaults & API Fixes
- Cleanup legacy Strava streams (4MB freed)
- Cap Strava API to 200 (no more 400 errors)

---

## **Current State (Your Logs):**

### ‚ùå **Still Broken:**
```
CFPrefsPlistSource: Attempting to store >= 4194304 bytes
stream_strava_16156463870: {length = 555820, bytes = ...}
```
**Cleanup didn't run** - you need to rebuild

```

**API cap didn't apply** - you need to rebuild

```
**Infinite loop still happening** - you need to rebuild

### ‚úÖ **Data IS in Core Data:**
```
üìä [Data] Core Data cached day: Optional(2025-10-17 23:00:00 +0000)
   Recovery: 61.0, Sleep: 50.0, Strain: 0.0
   HRV: 23.473108939531848, RHR: 67.0
   CTL: 71.53976428878823, ATL: 17.592321866017986, TSS: 0.0
```

You have **7 days of cached data** ready to display.

---

## **Your Architecture Question:**

> "Why calculate trends on-the-fly instead of storing them?"

**WE ARE STORING THEM!** Look at Core Data:

```swift
DailyPhysio {
    date, hrv, rhr, sleepDuration
    hrvBaseline, rhrBaseline, sleepBaseline
}

DailyLoad {
    date, ctl, atl, tsb, tss
}

DailyScores {
    date, recoveryScore, sleepScore, strainScore
}
```

**The charts fetch from this cache:**
```swift
let fetchRequest = DailyScores.fetchRequest()
fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(
    format: "date >= %@ AND date <= %@ AND recoveryScore > 0",
    startDate as NSDate,
    endDate as NSDate
)
```

**This is FAST** - no calculations, just a Core Data query.

---

## **What's Actually Happening:**

1. ‚úÖ Data is calculated once per day
2. ‚úÖ Data is stored in Core Data
3. ‚úÖ Charts fetch from Core Data (fast)
4. ‚ùå **OLD BUILD:** Charts have infinite loop bug
5. ‚ùå **OLD BUILD:** Charts never actually load the data

---

## **After Rebuild:**

### **Recovery Chart (7-day):**
- Fetches 7 `DailyScores` records
- Maps to `TrendDataPoint`
- Displays instantly
- **1 fetch, not 100+**

### **HRV Chart (7-day):**
- Fetches 7 `DailyPhysio` records
- Maps to `TrendDataPoint`
- Displays instantly
- **1 fetch, not 100+**

### **RHR Chart (7-day):**
- Fetches 7 `DailyPhysio` records
- Fetches min/max HR from HealthKit (async)
- Maps to `RHRDataPoint`
- Displays with candlesticks
- **1 Core Data fetch + 7 HealthKit queries**

---

## **Sleep Y-Axis Issue:**

This is a separate bug - the chart Y-axis doesn't match the data visual. Need to investigate the chart configuration.

---

## **Action Required:**

1. **Clean Build Folder** (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. **Rebuild** (Cmd+B)
3. **Run on device**
4. **Check console** - should see:
   ```
   üìä [RECOVERY CHART] 7 records ‚Üí 7 points for 7d view
   ‚ù§Ô∏è [HRV CHART] 7 records ‚Üí 7 points for 7d view
   üíî [RHR CHART] 7 points with real min/max for 7d view
   ```

5. **Charts should display** with 7 days of data

---

## **Summary:**

- ‚úÖ Architecture is correct (data cached in Core Data)
- ‚úÖ Fixes are in code (commits pushed)
- ‚ùå You're running old binary (rebuild required)
- ‚ùå Sleep Y-axis needs separate fix

**REBUILD NOW** to see all fixes working.
