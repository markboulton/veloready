# üéØ Apple Watch Setup Instructions

## What We Built

### 1. **WatchConnectivityManager** ‚úÖ
- Syncs recovery score to watch
- Syncs HRV/RHR data
- Requests health data FROM watch (preferred source)
- Queues data when watch not reachable

### 2. **Recovery Score Widget/Complication** ‚úÖ
- Shows on watch face
- Shows on iPhone home screen
- Updates every hour
- Color-coded by score
- Shows sparkles ‚ú® when ML is used

---

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Configure App Group (Required)

The widget needs to share data with the main app via an App Group.

1. **Open Xcode**
2. **Select VeloReady target**
3. **Go to Signing & Capabilities**
4. **Click "+ Capability"**
5. **Add "App Groups"**
6. **Click "+" and create:**
   ```
   group.com.markboulton.VeloReady
   ```

7. **Repeat for VeloReadyWidget target:**
   - Select **VeloReadyWidget** target (not RideReadyWidget - we renamed it)
   - Add "App Groups" capability
   - Enable the same group: `group.com.markboulton.VeloReady`

### Step 2: Test Widget on iPhone

1. **Build and run** the app on your iPhone
2. **Long press** on home screen
3. **Tap "+" button** (top left)
4. **Search for "VeloReady"**
5. **Add the widget** to your home screen
6. **Open the app** to calculate recovery score
7. **Wait ~1 minute** for widget to update

**Expected Result:**
- Widget shows your recovery score
- Shows band (Optimal/Good/Fair/Pay Attention)
- Color-coded (green/yellow/orange/red)
- If ML enabled: shows sparkles ‚ú®

### Step 3: Test Watch Complications (If you have Apple Watch)

1. **Pair your Apple Watch** with iPhone
2. **Open Watch app** on iPhone
3. **Go to Face Gallery**
4. **Choose a watch face** that supports complications
5. **Tap "Add"** then **"Customize"**
6. **Tap a complication slot**
7. **Scroll to find "VeloReady"**
8. **Select it**

**Complication Types:**
- **Circular**: Gauge with score in center
- **Rectangular**: Score + band + sparkles
- **Inline**: Text only ("Recovery: 75")

### Step 4: Enable Watch Connectivity (Optional - for future)

The WatchConnectivityManager is ready, but you'll need a Watch app target to fully utilize it.

**To add Watch app:**
1. File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Target
2. Choose "Watch App"
3. Name it "VeloReady Watch"
4. Add WatchConnectivity framework
5. Implement watch-side sync

**For now:** The widget/complication works without a full Watch app!

## How It Works

### Data Flow:

```
iPhone App
    ‚Üì
RecoveryScoreService calculates score
    ‚Üì
Saves to:
  1. UserDefaults (app cache)
  2. Shared UserDefaults (App Group) ‚Üê Widget reads this
  3. WatchConnectivityManager (for Watch app)
    ‚Üì
Widget/Complication updates every hour
```

### Widget Update Frequency:

- **Automatic**: Every 1 hour
- **Manual**: Pull down to refresh widget
- **On app open**: Immediate update
