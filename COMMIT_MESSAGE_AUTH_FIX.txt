Fix: Auto-refresh expired Supabase tokens to prevent auth failures

Problem:
- CTL/ATL charts showed 0 values after 1 hour of inactivity
- Supabase access tokens expire after 1 hour
- App wasn't refreshing expired tokens automatically
- Users had to sign out and sign back in manually

Solution:
- Auto-refresh expired tokens on app startup using refresh token
- Properly throw authentication errors instead of silently failing
- Proactively refresh tokens 5 minutes before expiration

Impact:
- No more manual sign out/in after 1 hour
- Charts always show correct values
- Better error handling for auth failures

Technical Changes:
- SupabaseClient: Added proactive token refresh in loadSession()
- VeloReadyAPIClient: Throw auth errors instead of continuing with expired tokens

Files Changed:
- VeloReady/Core/Networking/SupabaseClient.swift
- VeloReady/Core/Networking/VeloReadyAPIClient.swift
